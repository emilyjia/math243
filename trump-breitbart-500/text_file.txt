Verified left-wing users on Twitter celebrated the hospitalization of Donald Trump Jr.’s wife, Vanessa Trump, after she opened a letter addressed to Donald Trump Jr. which contained an unknown white powder.

Following the incident, journalist and producer Simon Thompson asked whether Vanessa Trump had to be “decontaminated” because of the white powder or because she’d “come into contact with Trump Jr.”

Too late dude

Twitter is forever pic.twitter.com/YpexPLJErj — Harriet Rooney (@hmbr123) February 12, 2018

Thompson quickly deleted the post and set his account to private.

After Trump Jr. announced on Twitter that “Vanessa & my children are safe and unharmed after the incredibly scary situation that occurred this morning,” the Socialist Party of Great Britain also seemingly condoned the attack, posting, “Disgusting people attract disgusting behavior.”

Tara Dublin, a journalist who has written for the Huffington Post, claimed on Twitter that the entire incident was a coverup for Vanessa Trump overdosing on cocaine — before deleting the post.

YOU GUYS, CHILL OUT. Vanessa & Don Jr have a history of coke abuse. Its a known thing. I made a dumb Twitter joke. They’re not all gold.

Dublin continued to spread conspiracy theories surrounding the incident’s validity, however.

Several other accounts verified by Twitter cracked jokes the Trumps abusing cocaine.

Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) called President Donald Trump a “psychopath” and declared America will regret the day Trump was born in a scathing Saturday evening tweet after Trump accused the FBI of failing to stop Florida school shooter Nikolas Cruz because the agency was too busy trying to prove the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians.

“You are such a psychopath that you have to make even the death of 17 children about you. America will regret the day you were ever born,” the Arizona Democrat weeted.

The Iraq War veteran was apparently triggered by Trump’s tweet that accused the FBI of spending “too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign” and missing “the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter.”

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Last month, a person close to Cruz reportedly contacted the FBI’s field office in Miami to warn the agency of Cruz’s “desire to kill people” and the “potential of him conducting a school shooting.” Last September, a Mississippi bail bondsman contacted the FBI after a YouTube user named “Nikolas Cruz” replied to one of his videos by commenting, “I’m going to be a professional school shooter.” Police officers also reportedly responded to Cruz’s home 39 times over a seven-year period.

Florida Governor Rick Scott on Friday called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to resign, saying the agency’s “failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable.”

“Seventeen innocent people are dead and acknowledging a mistake isn’t going to cut it,” Scott said. “An apology will never bring these 17 Floridians back to life or comfort the families who are in pain. The families will spend a lifetime wondering how this could happen, and an apology will never give them the answers they desperately need.”

Scott continued: “We constantly promote ‘see something, say something,’ and a courageous person did just that to the FBI. And the FBI failed to act. ‘See something, say something’ is an incredibly important tool and people must have confidence in the follow through from law enforcement. The FBI director needs to resign.”President Donald Trump reacted to the news that Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians for their attempts to disrupt the 2016 presidential election.

“The results of the election were not impacted,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “The Trump campaign did nothing wrong – no collusion!”

The president also pointed out that Russia’s attempt to disrupt the American political system began in 2014, long before he officially announced his run for president.

Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong – no collusion! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2018

In a statement issued by the White House, Trump continued.President Donald Trump again criticized Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the possibility that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, calling it a “witch hunt.”

The president expressed his thoughts on Twitter, quoting Judge Ken Starr and Jonathan Turley on the Russia investigation to bolster his case.

“I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U.S.,” Starr said. “I just don’t see it.”

Turley said he was skeptical about the investigation.

“I just don’t see the evidence….in terms of the collusion, it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have,” he said on Fox News.

The president also quoted Judge Andrew Napolitano for saying in an interview that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was guilty of criminal behavior.

“Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton’s criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated,” he said on Fox News. “I fully agree with the President on that.”

Trump’s conclusion was again that the investigation was a “witch hunt.”Rapper Killer Mike to ‘Progressive’ Gun Grabbers: ‘You’re not Woke,’ and ‘You’re Going to Progress Us into Slavery’David Smith reports in the Guardian:

[Bannon] is particularly scathing about a June 2016 meeting involving Trump’s son Donald Jr, son-in-law Jared Kushner, then campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in New York. A trusted intermediary had promised documents that would “incriminate” rival Hillary Clinton but instead of alerting the FBI to a potential assault on American democracy by a foreign power, Trump Jr replied in an email: “I love it.”

The meeting was revealed by the New York Times in July last year, prompting Trump Jr to say no consequential material was produced. Soon after, Wolff writes, Bannon remarked mockingly: “The three senior guys in the campaign thought it was a good idea to meet with a foreign government inside Trump Tower in the conference room on the 25th floor – with no lawyers. They didn’t have any lawyers.

“Even if you thought that this was not treasonous, or unpatriotic, or bad shit, and I happen to think it’s all of that, you should have called the FBI immediately.”

Bannon went on, Wolff writes, to say that if any such meeting had to take place, it should have been set up “in a Holiday Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire, with your lawyers who meet with these people”. Any information, he said, could then be “dump[ed] … down to Breitbart or something like that, or maybe some other more legitimate publication”.

Bannon added: “You never see it, you never know it, because you don’t need to … But that’s the brain trust that they had.”First Lady Melania Trump made a toast to Ireland and St. Patrick, wearing an emerald green, leopard-print shift dress as she and President Donald Trump greeted Ireland Prime Minister Leo Varadkar at the White House.

Melania chose the vibrant and bold dress by Brandon Maxwell, a young New York designer who also serves as Lady Gaga’s stylist, to commemorate St. Patrick’s Day ahead of the weekend holiday.

The dress features a “silk-blend, leopard-print jacquard in a rich shade of emerald green adds beautiful texture to a curve-hugging sheath styled with a modern midi-length hem,” as Neiman Marcus notes and is available for $1,595.

Melania paired the dress with black and white patterned Christian Louboutin pointed stilettos and her signature smoky eye makeup and windblown tresses.

“Caught RED HANDED,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen!”

Trump was referring to a story from South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo, reporting that United States satellites spotted 30 different illegal transactions of Chinese oil vessels transferring oil to North Korea.

According to a recent report in the New York Times, Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team at the time, is planning to tell the special counsel that Hicks suggested during a conference call with him and the president that the emails showing that the original purpose of the meeting was to get dirt on Hillary Clinton “will never get out.”

Hicks’ alleged suggestion could show that as she and the president crafted a press statement that said the meeting was primarily about a Russian adoption policy, she was aware that the original purpose of the meeting was to receive dirt on Clinton and concealed that from media.

Her suggestion also shows that she believed investigators would not find those emails despite requests by congressional investigators for the campaign to turn over all records related to meetings with Russians.

And according to the Times report, Hicks’ alleged suggestion hints “at an attempt to conceal the emails.”

The story noted that even if Hicks was hinting at concealing the emails from Congress, lawyers had already copied and stamped the emails for delivery to Capitol Hill. Trump Jr. also shortly thereafter released the emails to the public on his Twitter account.

And it noted that Corallo was alarmed by her comment, because “either she was being naïve or was suggesting that the emails could be withheld from investigators,” and also because she made the comment without a lawyer on the phone, which meant the conversation was not protected by attorney-client privilege.

Hicks’ lawyer Robert P. Trout aggressively denied Corallo’s allegations.

“As most reporters know, it’s not my practice to comment in response to questions from the media. But this warrants a response,” he said. “She never said that. And the idea that Hope Hicks ever suggested that emails or other documents would be concealed or destroyed is completely false.”

Some of Trump’s advisers argue that the Trump administration lying to the media about the meeting is not a crime, and that Mueller has no grounds to ask the president about the issue.

As the Times recounts, on July 7, 2017, its reporters approached the administration with questions about the June 9, 2016 meeting at Trump Tower, for a story that the meeting had taken place.

At the time, the president and senior White House officials were in Germany for the G-20 summit meeting. They asked for more time and scheduled a conference call that did not happen, and the reporters ended up submitting a list of questions.

Trump’s aides got the list mid-flight on the way back to Washington and began working on a response. Those involved in crafting the response were the president, Hicks, Trump Jr. and a lawyer for Trump Jr. via text message. (According to an account in the book Fire and Fury, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were also there at the beginning of the meeting).

According to the Times, the president supervised the writing of the statement, and a fierce debate erupted over how much information the news release should include. Trump was reportedly insistent about including language that said the meeting was about Russian adoptions.

(According to accounts by Trump Jr. and the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, they talked about repealing the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law punishing Russian corruption that prompted Russian President Vladimir Putin to retaliate by banning U.S. adoptions of Russian children. Veseltnitskaya was a key advocate for repealing the law).

The final statement from Trump Jr. to the Times read:

It was a short introductory meeting. I asked Jared and Paul to stop by. We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow up.

According to the Times‘ report, Trump Jr. had insisted that the word “primarily” be included in the statement.

Corallo, along with the rest of the president’s legal team, was not consulted about Donald Trump Jr.’s statement before it was released. He suggested in another report on the meeting by Circa that came out shortly thereafter, that the meeting might have been set up by Democratic operatives, since the Russian lawyer had also hired Fusion GPS, the firm that was also working on an anti-Trump dossier.

Hicks reportedly accused Corallo of “trafficking in conspiracy theories and drawing more attention to the story,” according to the Times.

The conference call with the president, Hicks, and Corallo took place the day after the meeting was reported by the Times and Circa.

According to Corallo, the statement drafted aboard Air Force One would backfire because documents would eventually surface showing the meeting was set up to get dirt on Clinton.

Hicks then reportedly responded that the emails “will never get out” because only a few people had access to them.

Corallo immediately notified the legal team and then-White House chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon of the conversation and took notes to memorialize it, according to the report.

Mueller sent out grand jury subpoenas for documents and interviews about the June 2016 meeting.Actress and singer Barbra Streisand took her criticism of President Donald Trump to a new level in an interview with Variety, in which she says Trump shares the blame for the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.

“I think even that shooter was affected because Trump brings out the violence in people,” Streisand says, of the mass shooting in Parkland, Florida, earlier this month that saw Nikalos Cruz kill 17 people with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle.

“He says, ‘It’s OK — rally, lock her up,'” Streisand told Variety of then-candidate Trump and a refrain he chanted about then-candidate Hillary Clinton at campaign rallies.

The two-time Academy Award-winner also praised the students campaigning for more gun control laws in the wake of the Florida shooting.

“I’m so proud of the children who are coming out and talking about sensible gun control,” she said. “That to me, the children, are our future. The children are going to make this happen. I believe that.”

Indeed, Barbra Streisand has long-criticized President Trump. She wrote a Huffington Post article last July, entitled “The Fake President,” in which she writes, “There’s a narcissistic fraud in the White House.”

The 74-year-old, who was a vocal supporter of Clinton, has also blamed President Trump for her weight gain.

“Donald Trump is making me gain weight,” Streisand wrote on Twitter. “I start the day with liquids, but after the morning news, I eat pancakes smothered in maple syrup!”

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonFirst Lady Melania Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida with President Trump and their son Barron, wearing a red coat with a matching bag and red shoe soles to tie the ensemble together.

Melania, hardly ever photographed in blue jeans, wore a pair of skinny, ankle-cut jeans with a navy blue sweater as the base of her outfit. Draped over her shoulders, as she often does, the Slovenian-born First Lady wore a red cashmere coat by the Parisian brand Maison Ullens.

To match the coat, Melania’s freshly done manicure clutched a red leather Gucci bag that seems to be a tote version of this signature Gucci top handle bag. As usual, Melania topped the look off with a pair of navy blue Christian Louboutin stilettos, walking like a runway model off Air Force One, giving a glimpse of the shoe brand’s famous red soles.

Melania and her husband will spend the weekend with their son Barron at the Mar-a-Lago resort to watch the NFL Superbowl, as they did last year.First Lady Melania Trump wore her patriotism on her sleeve in a varsity jacket with electric blue stilettos as she attended a Super Bowl LII party in Palm Beach, Florida at Mar-a-Lago with President Donald Trump.

Channeling her inner Sporty Spice, Melania wore a red, white, and blue — a nod to the New England Patriots — silk-satin AMIRI bomber jacket, trimmed with red leather. The varsity jacket is available at Net-a-Porter for $2,100.

The First Lady paired the varsity jacket with J Brand white skinny jeans and, in true Melania fashion, chose a pair of blue Christian Louboutins to take the ensemble from a street style look to runway-ready attire. Also, in a rare moment, Melania donned her hair in a feathered side-part rather than her signature middle-part.

“I used to date Ivanka, you know,” Jones told the outlet in response to a question about racism and Trumpism.

“Yes, sir. Twelve years ago,” the music mogul explained. “Tommy Hilfiger, who was working with my daughter Kidada, said, ‘Ivanka wants to have dinner with you.’ I said, ‘No problem. She’s a fine motherfucker.'”

“She had the most beautiful legs I ever saw in my life. Wrong father, though,” Jones said of Ivanka and President Trump.

The interview saw the 27-time Grammy-winner hurl one explicative-laden swipe at Trump after another.

Asked what “stirred everything up” racially in America, Jones said, “It’s Trump and uneducated rednecks. Trump is just telling them what they want to hear. I used to hang out with him. He’s a crazy motherfucker. Limited mentally — a megalomaniac, narcissistic. I can’t stand him.”

“He doesn’t know shit,” Jones said of President Trump, after being asked if he believes his friend Oprah Winfrey would be a good president. “Someone who knows about real leadership wouldn’t have as many people against him as he does. He’s a fucking idiot.”

Elsewhere in the interview, Jones suggested that Hillary Clinton’s secrets cost her the election.

“I was around the White House for eight years with the Clintons,” he said, later adding that so many people dislike like Hillary “because there’s a side of her — when you keep secrets, they backfire … I know too much, man.”

Speaking briefly about the wave of sexual assault and misconduct allegation against some of Hollywood biggest actors and executives, the 84-year-old Jones said, “Feminism: Women are saying they’re not going to take it anymore. Racism: People are fighting it. God is pushing the bad in our face to make people fight back.”

“Women had to put up with fucked-up shit. Women and brothers — we’re both dealing with the glass ceiling,” Jones said, adding, “It was all of them. Brett Ratner. [Harvey] Weinstein. Weinstein — he’s a jive motherfucker. Wouldn’t return my five calls. A bully.”

Asked about Bill Cosby, who’s been accused of assault by several women, Jones said, “We can’t talk about this in public, man.”

Jones also said Oprah Winfrey shouldn’t run for president because “she doesn’t have the chops for it.”

Last month Jones ripped pop superstar Taylor Swift’s songwriting ability, saying “we need more song man. Fucking songs, not hooks.”

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @JeromeEHudsonCNN’s well-documented, seemingly pathological hatred of President Donald Trump has now reached the point where the far-left cable channel will publish a story relying on experts who defend school shooters against Trump.

“In a tweet Thursday, President Donald Trump described someone who would shoot up a school as a ‘savage sicko,'” CNN reported last week, adding, “And at a White House briefing Thursday, the President again used the term ‘sicko.'”

To attack Trump over this, the news site quotes Diana Rose, one of the article’s “experts,” who defends the Parkland, Florida, killer with the risible claim that the president is “insulting” a mass-murderer.

“Rose said that calling the shooter a ‘sicko’ is ‘insulting’ and ‘mean-minded,'” CNN writes.

That is a direct quote from CNN — “calling the shooter a sicko is insulting and mean-minded.” Keep in mind that this CNN expert is not saying that calling the mentally ill names is detrimental to the mentally ill’s mental health, but she says that calling a school shooter names is insulting and mean. In other words, CNN’s go-to expert is defending a school shooter, a monster responsible for the deaths of 17 defenseless people, from insults and mean-mindedness.

Another CNN expert compares Trump’s use of the word “sicko” to using the N-word and adds that it is “disrespectful.”

“How helpful is calling a black person the n-word? Not only is it disrespectful, it fans racism,” Pat Corrigan told CNN.

Again, this CNN expert is not talking about the effect of name-calling on the mentally ill in a psychological or sociological sense. This is an expert scolding Trump for being “disrespectful” to school shooters; this is about condemning Trump for “insulting” a mass-murderer because it is akin to calling a black person the N-word.

CNN then appears to go so far as to ask us to sympathize with an alleged mass-murderer:

The shooter, Nikolas Cruz, struggled with depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and autism, according to a 2016 Florida Department of Children and Families report. But having a mental health diagnosis does not mean he would become violent, many experts say. And although Trump has said he wants to focus on mental health to stop school shootings, calling Cruz a “sicko” doesn’t help, those experts claim.

While CNN defends school shooters, elsewhere on the last-placed network, CNN is allowing the NRA to be smeared as “child murderers.”

The San Francisco Chronicle reports:

A massive chicken that bears a striking resemblance to the 45th president of the United States set sail about the island Saturday afternoon. A large boat, generally used to transport fish not fowl, was chartered for the occasion – a protest of President Donald Trump on a weekend designated for celebrating presidents. … Trump Chicken’s shirt in this case is striped in black and white and embroidered with the “prisoner number” 00045. That, coupled with its sailing destination (around and around and around Alcatraz), should make the organizers’ intended message clear to landlubbers perplexed by the sight of a chicken in the sea.

The great Trump Chicken sail has been months in the making. Morton debuted the bird at last year’s Tax Day Protest, a national demonstration intended to pressure Trump to release his tax returns. The chicken was the undisputed Instagram star of the day, and the concept – inflated fowl as resistance fodder – spread to activists across the country. Now, there are Trump Chickens clucking in Chicago, New York and Washington D.C.

The Alcatraz prank had originally been planned as a counter-demonstration against the Patriot Prayer protest last August, according to the Chronicle, but the protest was moved.

Onlookers and journalists were impressed:

Photo: fileAhead of the all-important American Conservative Union (ACU) annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Never Trump leaders are out in full force whining about the pinnacle conservative movement event’s decidedly pro-Trump agenda this year.

The decision to focus on the future economic nationalist vision of the Republican Party on everything from trade to China to immigration and more, while bringing in many speakers, from President Donald Trump himself to Vice President Mike Pence on down through several members of his administration, “Mr. Brexit” Nigel Farage, and National Front leader Marion Le Pen has triggered some of the anti-Trump so-called conservatives. Notably not speaking, however, is newly announced Utah Senate candidate Mitt Romney–the former Massachusetts governor, failed 2012 GOP presidential nominee, and Never Trump leader from 2016. The completion of Trump’s economic nationalist takeover of the conservative movement and Republican Party has these Never Trumpers whining all over Twitter:

And President Trump himself is fighting back alongside Schlapp, too, tweeting that he is excited to speak there this week:

Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. You’ve come a long way Matt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018

This year’s event, as Breitbart News reported in an exclusive interview with Schlapp, ACU executive Dan Schneider and ACU communications director Ian Walters will focus on the key steps the movement will take moving forward.

“We feel vindicated,” Schlapp told Breitbart News. “After all of the internal family squabbling in the conservative movement and Republican Party and country generally [over the past several years], we feel vindicated that CPAC has been a moment where we in a very public way can talk about our disagreements and it has resulted over the last three CPACs in us having more political success and policy success as a movement than we have ever had. That means this is a critical four days and that we have set up the debate and the discussions once again where we can do this in a way that will make us stronger, not weaker.”

Schneider added that this is the first time in history both the sitting president and vice president have spoken at CPAC in two consecutive years and that a record number of Cabinet officials from any administration ever are coming from the Trump administration this year.

“This is the first time in history that we’ve two years in a row have a president and vice president come two years in a row to CPAC,” Schneider said. “It’s also the first time we’ve had such a large percentage of the Cabinet come to CPAC. The prior record was in Reagan’s second term where about a third of the Cabinet spoke. This time, about half of the Cabinet will be at CPAC.”

CPAC has been running since the early 1970s.Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal’s name is cropping up again, but this time, as a potential key figure involved with the Trump dossier and the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign.

Republican congressional investigators appear to be zeroing in on Blumenthal, and the role he may have played in feeding information that Trump dossier author Christopher Steele later presented to the FBI in its investigation of the Trump campaign.

The prospect of Blumenthal — a long-time Clinton operative — feeding information for an FBI investigation on the Trump campaign has caused alarm among Republican lawmakers in charge of oversight of the FBI and the Justice Department.

The Washington Post on Tuesday reported that Steele gave the FBI a report in October 2016 that he received from a State Department employee about Trump and Russia.

According to the Post, the report was written by Cody Shearer, a former journalist with close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, who gave it to Blumenthal, who gave it to State Department official Jonathan Winer, who gave it to Steele, who then gave it to the FBI.

Shearer’s report claimed a source inside the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) spy agency alleged that Trump had financial ties to influential Russians and that the FSB had evidence of him engaging in compromising personal behavior.

A lawyer for Winer, Lee Wolosky, told the Post his client told the Post his client’s actions were “grounded” in concerns that a candidate for the presidency may have been compromised by a hostile foreign power. Wolosky did not say why Winer gave the report to Steele instead of the FBI.

The Guardian, which has ties to ex-British spy Steele, also reported recently that Shearer wrote a report that was given to Steele. Shearer had also shared his report with “select media organizations before the election,” according to the British paper.

Blumenthal and Shearer’s names were first tied to the FBI’s investigation of the Trump campaign in a letter sent last month by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to the Democratic National Committee.

Grassley and Graham wanted the DNC to disclose any communications with Blumenthal and Shearer from March 2016 to January 2017. Earlier this week, the two GOP senators released a redacted memo that described the transmission of a report from a Clinton friend to Steele:

“One memorandum by Mr. Steele that was not published by Buzzfeed is dated October 19, 2016. The report alleges [redacted], as well as [redacted]. Mr. Steele’s memorandum states that his company “received this report from [redacted] U.S. State Department,” that the report was the second in a series, and that the report was information that came from a foreign sub-source who ‘is in touch with [redacted], a contact of [redacted], a friend of the Clintons, who passed it to [redacted].”

They added, “It is troubling enough that the Clinton Campaign funded Mr. Steele’s work, but that these Clinton associates were contemporaneously feeding Mr. Steele allegations raises additional concerns about his credibility.”

Since the names are redacted by the FBI, they cannot be disclosed publicly by those who have seen them. Lawmakers who have seen the unredacted versions have danced around who they are.

When asked on FOX News’s The Story, House Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC) told anchor Martha MacCallum that she was “really warm” if she believed that Blumenthal was part of the chain of information to Steele described by Grassley and Graham.

“I’m trying to think how Secretary Clinton defined him. I think she said he was an old friend who emailed her from time to time,” he said on Tuesday.

MacCallum then asked, “Sidney Blumenthal?” Gowdy responded, “That’d be really warm. You’re warm. Yeah.”

House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) also mentioned Blumenthal and Shearer’s role on Fox & Friends on Tuesday.

“What it looks like is, they paid Steele to put together the dossier and told him what to put in,” he said.

Micah Morin, chief investigative reporter at Judicial Watch, questioned whether Shearer and Blumenthal were also behind the dossier’s sources. He wrote:

According to the Guardian, Steele provided ‘a copy [of the Shearer report] because it corresponded with what he had separately heard from his own independent sources.’ If the reporting here is accurate, that’s quite a coincidence—that Cody Shearer and Christopher Steele were hearing the same things from different sources at pretty much the same time. A closer look at timelines and sources might be revealing. If Sid and Cody are behind the original Russian dossier sources, that would be big news indeed.

“It’s an astonishing, convoluted and somewhat circular chain of custody in which a Clinton source, that is Shearer and Blumenthal, gives it to the former, to the State Department where she used to be Secretary of State, who gives it to Christopher Steele, who’s being paid by the Clinton campaign, who then gives it to the FBI,” the Washington Examiner‘s Chief Political Correspondent Byron York said on the Hugh Hewitt radio show Wednesday.

Blumenthal has a known history of smearing opponents of the Clintons.

During Bill Clinton’s impeachment crisis, as one of Clinton’s special advisers, he spread rumors that one of independent counsel Kenneth Starr’s prosecutors abused young boys at a Christian summer camp and that Monica Lewinsky was stalking the president, according to the Observer. He also spread rumors that Colin Powell’s wife suffered from clinical depression and was unfit to be a first lady, according to publication.

As a former journalist, Blumenthal also used his media contacts to give the Clintons a heads up about forthcoming stories, and advised the Clinton campaign in 2008 to target then-candidate Sen. Barack Obama’s (D-IL) ties to Reverend Jeremiah Wright and Louis Farrakhan.

After Obama White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel refused to allow Blumenthal to join the Clinton State Department, he became a Clinton Foundation consultant, earning at least $120,000 a year. He continued to advise her in a number of areas, according to emails released by the State Department.

Less is known about Shearer. According to a recent article in the Washington Times, he was dubbed “Mr. Fixer” for Bill and Hillary Clinton and was a “workmate” of Blumenthal.

Shearer went from a journalist decades ago to foreign policy freelancer – once trying to broker some sort of peace deal in Bosnia, although he was not a U.S. official, – and working with Blumenthal to supply intelligence on Libya to Clinton when she was secretary of state. According to investigative journalist Sara Carter, Shearer worked in the 1990s for President Bill Clinton.

Nonprofit investigative journalism outlet ProPublica described Shearer as “a longtime Clinton family operative — his brother was an ambassador under Bill Clinton and his now-deceased sister was married to Clinton State Department official Strobe Talbott — who was in close contact with Blumenthal.”

According to Judicial Watch’s Morin, Shearer “has a long history of dirty tricks.”

“He’s been linked to Whitewater-era efforts to dirty up Bill Clinton critics; to shakedown politics involving the Cheyenne-Arapaho Indian tribe; and to fronting for Bosnian Serb butcher Radovan Karadzic,” he wrote.

As the Times has noted, for whom Shearer produced his anti-Trump report is unclear.

Even less known about Jonathan Winer. Winer served as the State Department’s Special Envoy for Libya and Senior Advisor for MEK resettlement, according to the State Department website.

According to CNN, Winer worked with Steele from 2014 through 2016. Steele reportedly provided Winer with reports related to the conflict in Ukraine and Russia as a courtesy.

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA), who led efforts to show that senior FBI and DOJ officials relied on the dossier to get a surveillance warrant on a former Trump campaign adviser, has said there will be a forthcoming memo on the State Department’s role in the FBI’s investigation of Trump, but has not said when that might be released.President Donald Trump’s daughter-in-law, Vanessa Trump, has been taken to a Manhattan hospital after a suspicious letter that contained an unidentified substance was sent to the apartment where she and husband Donald Trump Jr. live.

Two other people at the residence were also taken to New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center as a precaution, the New York City Fire Department told NBC.

New York City police and fire department personnel responded to a call at around 10 a.m. this morning from the Trump’s apartment in Manhattan.

NBC is reporting that “multiple law enforcement officials” said that the field test as to whether the substance was a biological agent came back negative.

The outlet added that the three people taken to the hospital, including Vanessa Trump, were transported there as a precaution and that there was “no indication” that the substance inside the letter was “dangerous.”

Police are investigating the letter’s source. The Secret Service confirmed it is investigating the incident, as well.

The former UKIP leader made the comments ahead of his appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), where he will spend three days meeting Republican governors and conservative campaigners.

“I want to say to the audience at CPAC: ‘Please don’t judge my country by London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Mr. Corbyn, and the left who every time the President is going to visit the UK promise mass street protests’,” Mr. Farage told Fox and Friends.

“Actually, the truth of it is that in the UK, too, people are beginning to get the Trump message and he would be very welcome to come to our country.”

Left-wing Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has encouraged mass protests against the U.S. President, despite a plurality of Brits now backing him visiting the UK after a recent surge of support in the polls.

Mr. Khan, meanwhile, has relentlessly agitated against President Trump, flying to the U.S. to campaign against his election, claiming he is “not welcome” in London, and even comparing him to Islamic State terrorists.

Forget @SadiqKhan, @JeremyCorbyn and the hard left protesters. Trump is welcome in the UK and I'm in Washington to spread that message. #CPAC2018 pic.twitter.com/K6RavsTq9K — Nigel Farage (@Nigel_Farage) February 22, 2018

Prime Minister Theresa May extended an invitation to President Trump for a full state visit when the two leaders met in the White House last year, but the planned trip has been repeatedly pushed back.

He was expected to fly to Britain to formally open the new U.S. embassy in London this month, but pulled out at the last minute, blaming the Obama administration for selling the previous embassy for ”peanuts”.

Mayor Khan celebrated the cancellation, claiming President Trump would have been met with “mass protests” and saying he did not support the “values” of London.

Asked what his message about President Trump would be to CPAC, Farage added: “I shall say that here’s a man who is keeping faith with his electorate.”

He continued: “Don’t be distracted by everybody’s excitement over [globalist French president Emmanuel] Macron… The revolution of those that believe in nation-state and national identity is still rolling.

“The vote that is called ‘populist’ in Europe averaged 8 per cent in 2000, it is now 24 per cent. The pivot that 2016 represents was far from being a temporary blip.”“Everything they’re accusing Trump of … Obama had done,” said Lee Smith of “Trump-Russia collusion” narratives pushed by Democrats and their news media allies.

Smith, senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, joined SiriusXM’s Breitbart News Tonight for a Thursday interview with Breitbart News’s Senior Editors-at-Large Rebecca Mansour and Joel Pollak to discuss his latest article, “The Media Stopped Reporting the Russia Collusion Story Because They Helped Create It.”

Smith highlighted the Washington Post’s Anne Applebaum, the Atlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg, and the New Yorker’s David Remnick as hypocritical news media figures in their criticisms of the Trump administration’s supposed appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin after ignoring actual appeasement of Russia and Vladimir Putin across eight years of the Obama administration.

On March 26, 2012, then-President Barack Obama told then-Russian President Dmitri Medvedev that he would have “more flexibility” in shaping U.S. foreign policy toward Russia after that year’s presidential election:



“Big-name” and “respected’ journalists like Applebaum, Goldberg, and Remnick “enlisted their bylines in a political campaign on behalf of the Democratic candidate for president,” wrote Smith. In so doing, the trio of left-wing Democrat news media figures “rehearsed the talking points [Christopher Steele] later documented.”

Special counsel Robert Mueller’s ostensible investigation into the “Russian government’s attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election” is predicated on lies within the “Christopher Steele dossier,” said Smith: “The Mueller investigation is premised on the Steele dossier. It’s premised on nonsense.”

Steele’s allegations – paid for by Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee – were central to the procurement of surveillance warrants via the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) for Trump campaign operatives Carter Page and George Papadopoulos (FISC) at the request of Justice Department and FBI officials during the Obama administration.

“It’s insane. … She’s describing some scenario that’s out of a B movie about all these conspiracies taking place,” said Smith of Applebaum’s 2016 warning that Russia would determine the outcome of the year’s presidential election.

In her September 8, 2016, article entitled “How Russia could spark a U.S. electoral disaster,” Applebaum warned that “Russian hackers will seek to break into the U.S. voting system [and] attempt to throw the election.” She further claimed the Russian state “might try to get Trump elected,” or even Clinton.” Alternatively — and this would, of course, be even more devastating — [Russia] might try to rig the election for Clinton, perhaps leaving a trail of evidence designed to connect the rigging operation to Clinton’s campaign.”

At the time, Pollak described Applebaum’s warning as a “bizarre conspiracy theory.”

Applebaum is regularly featured across television news media outlets as a non-ideological and non-partisan expert of international affairs, with a focus on Europe and Russia.

Left-wing and Democrat-aligned news media outlets succeeded in their desire to prompt a federal investigation of Donald Trump and his presidential campaign to diffuse the public’s attention toward the ostensible investigation of Hillary Clinton’s felonious mishandling of classified information and evasion of record-keeping laws, said Smith.

“Journalists were participating in a political campaign,” said Smith. “Hillary had an investigation, so the idea was, ‘Well, let’s stick Trump with an investigation, too.’ And that’s what they got. They got an investigation of the Trump campaign, which was insane enough.”

The fraudulent investigation of the Trump campaign then morphed into an attempt to nullify the outcome of 2016’s presidential election, said Smith.

“After the election, it turned into something even worse,” said Smith. “It turned into an attack, not just on the president. … The purpose was to delegitimize the political choice that American voters made in electing the person that they wanted to be president. It’s an absolutely obscene campaign that the press waged. First, it was against Trump. Then, it was against the American public.”

Steele had utilized an “echo chamber” strategy among left-wing and partisan news media allies to push the “Trump-Russia collusion” narrative upon the American electorate, wrote Smith: “Much of the Russiagate campaign was conducted in this circular manner. Steele and Simpson built an echo chamber with their opposition research, parts of the law enforcement and intelligence communities, and the press all reinforcing one another.”

The news media are broadly avoiding the “falling apart” of Mueller’s ostensible investigation given their central role in its genesis, said Smith.

“Everything they’re accusing Trump of leaning toward, the Obama administration has done,” said Smith. “In Ukraine, in Syria. Whether or not you agree with Obama’s policy — I did not — but whether or not you agree with it, the fact is this is what the Obama administration did. All of a sudden, for the same people, like David Remnick, like Jeffrey Goldberg, who were speaking with President Obama extensively [and] repeatedly, for them to somehow ignore that this is what Obama had done and that suddenly, Trump was this insane outlier, that this had never happened before, that, in itself, was a huge tell.”

LISTEN:

President Donald Trump again dismissed the phony Russia “dossier” after watching a Fox News report discrediting the information in it.

“WOW,” Trump wrote, pointing to the Fox & Friends report. “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.”

Trump appeared amazed that the dossier was used to accuse his campaign of colluding with Russia.

“[T]hey used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!” he exclaimed:

WOW, @foxandfrlends “Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED.” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2017

Trump commented on the dossier after former Congressman Jason Chaffetz dismissed the document as “bogus” in an interview on Fox & Friends, pointing to reports that the FBI refused to reveal who funded the opposition research document.Tax cuts. Deregulation. More for the military; less for the United Nations. The Islamic State crushed in its heartland. Assad hit with cruise missiles. Troops to Afghanistan. Arms for Ukraine. A tougher approach to North Korea. Jerusalem recognized as Israel’s capital. The Iran deal decertified. Title IX kangaroo courts on campus condemned. Yes to Keystone. No to Paris. Wall Street roaring and consumer confidence high.

And, of course, Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court. What, for a conservative, is there to dislike about this policy record as the Trump administration rounds out its first year in office?

That’s the question I keep hearing from old friends on the right who voted with misgiving for Donald Trump last year and now find reasons to like him. I admit it gives me pause. I agree with every one of the policy decisions mentioned above. But I still wish Hillary Clinton were president.If you thought President Donald Trump was great in 2017, you ain’t seen nothing yet: wait until Trump 2018, a report from Axios’s Mike Allen on Friday morning argues.

Citing multiple sources who have met or spoken recently with the president, Allen reports that those in the know in Washington should expect the “full Trump” in 2018—the president’s upcoming second year.

“If you ask some close to President Trump what worries them most about 2018, it’s not Robert Mueller’s probe,” Allen writes under a headline saying to expect Trump to be “unchained” in 2018. “It’s that establishment guardrails of 2017 come down — and Trump’s actual instincts take over.”

“Next year will bring ‘full Trump,’ said one person who recently talked to the president,” Allen adds.

Allen notes that most of Trump’s major 2017 achievements could have been made by any old traditional Republican, from the tax cuts plan to Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch and cutting regulations.

“Most of those in his current decision-making circle — even if they’re not mainstream Republicans — are defending mainstream Republican principles like free trade and an internationalist view of foreign policy,” Allen writes. “But top officials paint a different portrait of Trump when it comes to what he really wants on trade, immigration and North Korea — but has been tamped down by skeptical staff and Cabinet officials.”

Privately, Trump is throwing down entirely with the economic nationalist roots of his presidency.

“Trump keeps asking for tariffs — on steel and aluminum, in particular,” Allen writes. “He wants a trade war, and has for many years. His economic and diplomatic advisers persuaded him to delay trade actions in 2017.”

And while 2017 was defined by behind-the-scenes who’s up, who’s down power struggles in the administration and West Wing over which policies would win out, Allen notes that 2018 seems to be heading in the direction of a place where it doesn’t matter which measly globalist advisers are riding high at any given moment.

“Those advisers recognize that the day of reckoning will come in 2018, regardless of whether economic adviser Gary Cohn and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson — who advocated restraint — stay or go,” Allen writes.

Allen specifically pointed to a couple of recent Trump comments—one via Twitter and the other via his New York Times interview—on China, where the president ripped China on trade and North Korea.

“China’s hurting us very badly on trade, but I have been soft on China because the only thing more important to me than trade is war. O.K.?” Trump told the New York Times.

On Twitter, he wrote:

Caught RED HANDED – very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea. There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2017

Allen says that Trump has trade actions planned next month, too, something that other reports indicate are splitting Trump from GOP leaders. A recent headline in the Hill newspaper read, “GOP frustration rises with Trump on trade.”

The piece from Alex Bolton quotes several Senate Republicans, including Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), who raise concerns with President Trump and his administration’s efforts to put America first on trade.

But Allen notes that while Trump may have delayed acting on some of his economic nationalist instincts in 2017 to appease advisers’ demands, expect him to move forward with or without the useless advisers in 2018.

“Look for Trump to take action on trade in the next month. It probably won’t be next week, so as not to disrupt the afterglow of the tax cut. But nothing is final,” Allen writes, adding, “Trump still wants his wall, and tighter restrictions on legal immigration. He’s a true believer on this stuff, and knows intuitively that it keeps his base stoked.”Comedian Kathy Griffin claims the infamous bloody shock photograph of herself clutching the fake, decapitated head of President Donald Trump would have blown over within days had Trump himself not responded to the photo on social media.

In an interview with Politico this week, the 57-year-old My Life on the D-List star said she still cannot book stand-up concerts anywhere in the United States, seven months after the photo was first published by TMZ.

“I think it would have been gone in a week without his tweet,” Griffin told Politico. “Trump knows what would be perceived as something hysterical and he loves hysteria. There are millions of people who think I’m a member of ISIS to this day.”

The photograph — taken by photographer Tyler Shields — first hit the Internet on May 30. Griffin issued an apology the same day, saying the image had gone “too far,” but months later apparently retracted her apology, explaining she didn’t believe she had done anything wrong.

Trump responded to the photo in a tweet the following day, explaining that his children, including his young son Barron, were having a “hard time” with the image. One report claimed Barron had seen the photograph on television and had “panicked,” not knowing who Griffin is or whether the photograph was fake.

Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children, especially my 11 year old son, Barron, are having a hard time with this. Sick! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 31, 2017

Griffin added that she thinks Trump seized upon the photograph to “distract” from his then-recent firing of FBI director James Comey.

The photograph was met with widespread condemnation as Griffin was almost immediately fired from CNN, where she had hosted the network’s New Year’s Eve coverage for a decade, saw numerous stops on her cross-country tour canceled, and was questioned by the U.S. Secret Service.

In June, Griffin held a press conference with attorney Lisa Bloom in which she also blamed Trump for the reaction to the photograph and said she believed the backlash was sexist.

“It’s a bunch of white guys trying to silence me,” she said. “This wouldn’t be happening to a guy. This is a woman thing.”

Griffin told Politico she can no longer perform in the U.S. as a result of the backlash, but has found keen audiences overseas.

“They were thrilled to have someone come over and make fun of Trump,” she said. “I wish I could tour in the U.S. without getting shot — I know I can’t. I was in the middle of a 50-city tour when the tweet happened. It was canceled in 24 hours.”

“Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!” Trump said in a tweet posted on Friday.

Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 29, 2017

Trump’s claim that the USPS is losing billions of dollars is entirely correct, in 2016 the USPS announced a $5.6 billion net loss and in 2017 stated a $2.7 billion net loss, making this the eleventh year that the Postal Service has announced a loss. The total from 2007-17 amounts to a staggering $65.1 billion in losses. Things do not seem to be looking up for the organization anytime soon, with the USPS predicting in their public 2018 Integrated Financial Plan that they would suffer a net loss of $5.2 billion in 2018. With mail volume at a 29 year low and amassing large amounts of debt, the Postal Service is facing a tough time ahead.

However, a bipartisan bill has been proposed that would help the Postal Service. The USPS operates under a law from 2006 that restricts how much they can charge for stamps, how much they must pay into retiree health funds, and other general restrictions on business operations. Some elements of that law expired in 2016, such as the one stating that USPS must pay $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion into retiree health funds, but this new bill would see the law revamped entirely to help the Postal Service compete in the modern age. “Once enacted, and together with aggressive management actions, the Postal Service can meet all of our obligations and continue to improve the way we serve the American public,” said Postmaster General Megan Brennan in testimony to Congress.

Another element hampering the Postal Service is the price it charges to deliver packages for e-commerce giant Amazon. A Citigroup analysis in July of 2017 found that a subsidy of $1.46 was attached to every Amazon package delivered by USPS due to the Postal Service delivering the company’s packages below their own costs. It was determined in 2007 by the Postal Service and its regulator that a minimum of 5.5 percent of the Postal Service’s fixed costs must be allocated to package deliveries. Ten years later, despite 25 percent of USPS’s revenue coming from packages, the percentage of fixed costs allocated to packages has not increased enough to become profitable.

According to Citigroup’s analysis, if these costs were fairly redistributed and allocated, the average parcel would cost around $1.46 more to deliver. Amazon has used a method called “postal injection” to save money on their own deliveries, delivering pre-sorted Amazon packages to local post office delivery depots for “last mile” deliveries to be made by the USPS at a greatly discounted price. With Amazon warehouses located near many USPS depots, Amazon has managed to outsource almost two-thirds of their deliveries to the United States Postal Service.

So is President Trump right in saying that the USPS should be charing Amazon much more? Based on the current figures relating to the number of packages the USPS delivers for Amazon, the price they charge for delivery, and the Postal Service’s current financial state, the answer is clearly yes.

The progress of the proposed Postal Service Reform Act that would give USPS greater control over their business dealings can be followed here.First lady Melania Trump pushed back on the criticism of her in Michael Wolff’s book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, calling the book “fiction,” through her communications director.

“The book is a work of fiction,” Stephanie Grisham said in a statement provided to CNN.

“It is a long-form tabloid that peddles false statements and total fabrications about Mrs. Trump,” Grisham said. ”In short, it’s irresponsible and yet another ‘journalist’ looking to profit off the Trump family and this administration.”

Grisham spoke out against the book earlier when excerpts were released, including the author’s claim that Melania Trump was deeply saddened when her husband, Donald Trump, was elected president.

“This book is clearly going to be sold in the bargain fiction section,” Grisham said. “Mrs. Trump supported her husband’s decision to run for president and, in fact, encouraged him to do so.”

“She was confident he would win and was very happy when he did,” Grisham said.

CNN reported:

Grisham’s most recent response came on the heels of passages in Wolff’s book that claim the President is a chronic philanderer, and that Mr. and Mrs. Trump wouldn’t see each other for days at a time, even when both were at Trump Tower in New York. Wolff also wrote Trump was an absentee father to the couple’s son, Barron Trump.

“Freedom of speech does not mean the freedom to tell lies,” Grisham said about the book’s claims. “Perhaps one day she will tell her own truthful story, but until then Mrs. Trump is focused on her role as first lady.”

In the Author’s Note section of the book, Wolff admits his book contains a “looseness of the truth.”

“Many of the accounts of what has happened in the Trump White House are in conflict with one another; many, in Trumpian fashion, are baldly untrue,” Wolff wrote. “Those conflicts, and that looseness with the truth, if not with reality itself, are an elemental thread of the book.”

President Trump also is pushing back against Wolff’s charges about his mental stability and intelligence.

….Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart. Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames. I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T.V. Star….. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2018First Lady Melania Trump celebrated New Year’s Eve Sunday night alongside President Trump and their son, Barron, in a glittering party dress inspired by the Reagan era of the 1980s.

Melania arrived at the Trump administration’s Mar-a-Lago New Year’s Eve party as the glitter queen of the night, wearing a full-sequined t-length pink Erdem “Emery” party dress with voluminous sleeves and a mock neckline. The dress from the British label is currently sold out at Neiman Marcus.

In head-to-toe sequins, Melania shined next to her two dates, President Donald Trump and Barron Trump, who both donned classic tuxedos.

From the puff sleeves to the floral embellishments, Melania’s ensemble has a prosperous 1980s vibe with which fashion designers are currently obsessed.

Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband Jared Kushner arrived at the red carpet affair with their children in tow. Ivanka picked a rather risqué David Koma-designed dress for a White House adviser.

As if the side cut-outs were not revealing enough, the giant slit up the front of the dress and barely-there stilettos would be fabulous on any Hollywood gal stumbling out of a club, but this gal is the daughter to the president.

“Kim Kardashian Goes to the White House” is not an ideal look for a White House trying to trim its reality television roots.

Meanwhile, Eric and Lara Trump were all class as they arrived in black-tie attire. Eric in a classic men’s tuxedo and Lara in a sexy, yet subtle black Elvis-like jumpsuit with bell bottom pant legs and pointed stilettos.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and his wife, Scottish actress Louise Linton, were a mess in white. Steve looked more like a high-class waiter than an adviser to the president.

Louise wore an incredibly ill-fitting white dress (Yikes!). Though her blonde hair was divine in an updo, her fur shrug was not enough to save this generally bad ensemble.President Donald Trump responded personally to his former chief strategist Steve Bannon’s comments about his family members Jared Kushner and Donald Trump Jr.

The statement was released to reporters by press secretary Sarah Sanders prior to the White House press briefing.

The president unleashed a torrent of accusations against Bannon, accusing him of losing his mind after leaving the White House, and having very little to do with his presidency.

Trump also taunted Bannon for supporting Republican senate candidate Roy Moore in the Alabama Senate race and losing to the Democrat.

“Steve doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself,” Trump said.

The president also accused Bannon for leaking false information to the media about his influence and importance and accused him of trying to burn down his MAGA agenda.

Full text below:

Steve Bannon has nothing to do with me or my Presidency. When he was fired, he not only lost his job, he lost his mind. Steve was a staffer who worked for me after I had already won the nomination by defeating seventeen candidates, often described as the most talented field ever assembled in the Republican party. Now that he is on his own, Steve is learning that winning isn’t as easy as I make it look. Steve had very little to do with our historic victory, which was delivered by the forgotten men and women of this country. Yet Steve had everything to do with the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans. Steve doesn’t represent my base—he’s only in it for himself. Steve pretends to be at war with the media, which he calls the opposition party, yet he spent his time at the White House leaking false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was. It is the only thing he does well. Steve was rarely in a one-on-one meeting with me and only pretends to have had influence to fool a few people with no access and no clue, whom he helped write phony books. We have many great Republican members of Congress and candidates who are very supportive of the Make America Great Again agenda. Like me, they love the United States of America and are helping to finally take our country back and build it up, rather than simply seeking to burn it all down.

After leaving the White House, Bannon returned to Breitbart News as chairman and the host of the radio show Breitbart News Daily on Sirius/XM Patriot.Actor and left-wing activist Rob Reiner railed against President Donald Trump Saturday at the Women’s March in Los Angeles, calling Trump a “racist,” a “sexist,” and a “pathological liar.”

“We were all here a year ago for many different reasons. But one of the unifying reasons was we were scared,” Reiner told the crowd of mostly women, at an event that marked the one-year anniversary of the Women’s March that helped spark the anti-Trump Resistance.

“We were scared of who was going to enter the White House. A year has gone by. And he has corroborated every one of our fears,” Reiner said.

“And we cannot white wash this anymore. We have a racist in the White House,” the All in the Family star screamed. “We have a sexist in the White House. We have a pathological liar in the White House. And he is tearing away at the fabric of our democracy.”

Reiner’s speech was met with cheers from the crowd, who were also treated to speeches from actresses Olivia Wilde, Scarlett Johansson, Viola Davis, Natalie Portman, Elizabeth Banks, Mila Kunis, and Eva Longoria.

“When we all came together last time, we had the power,” Reiner said. And it’s the women, the women have given us the power. And the women continue to give us the power.”

Last June, Rob Reiner called for an “all out war” to resist President Trump.

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter: @jeromeehudsonIn these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason.

In this week’s exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie opines on the recent government shutdown, why celebrities are so angry with President Donald Trump, and on Sunday night’s Grammy Awards, which Jackie predicts will just be another anti-Trump spectacle.

“During the [shutdown], one thing was definite; that they were going to get paid. The soldiers who protect our lives? They don’t have to get paid,” Jackie says, calling out Sen. Chuck “The Schmuck” Schumer in the process.

“Why should they get paid for doing nothing? They should have to prove they accomplished something before they get paid.”

Jackie says it was inevitable that Hollywood was going to blame Trump for the government shutdown, even if nearly everything else they’ve tried to pin on him has failed.

“First, they said he’s crazy. Turns out, not only is he not crazy, but he’s very healthy,” Jackie says. “They claimed he was a Russian spy, and that caved in. You know what else they said would fail? The whole economy. It’s gonna go into the toilet. Just the opposite happened. The economy’s so fantastic it’s going through the roof.”

“Obviously you know what’s really bothering them? Not that he’s a failure. What’s really killing them is that he’s too successful.”

Jackie called out Carrey, who recently suggested Trump was pushing America into “suffering beyond all imagination,” and Penn, who recently called Trump an “enemy of mankind.”

“What really makes America suffer beyond imagination has nothing to do with Trump. What really makes us suffer is watching one of [Carrey’s] movies.”

And on Penn’s “enemy of mankind” comment, Jackie muses: “This from a jerkoff who vacations in Cuba with his best friend, Castro. Or in Venezuela, one of the greatest shithole paradises of all time, thanks to his other friend, Maduro.”

“All these celebrities say they can’t wait to get rid of this shithole president. I got a better idea. Why don’t we get rid of all these shithole actors? And I say this with the highest respect.”

Watch until the end of the video, when Jackie gives his predictions for Sunday night’s Grammy Awards.

Follow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaumTrump-supporting PAC Women Vote Trump has endorsed former chief of staff for Sen. Ted Cruz, Chip Roy for Congress in Texas’ 21st congressional district.

“Chip Roy is a true Constitutional conservative that stands for securing the border, reducing federal spending, restoring our healthcare freedom, reducing federal regulations, keeping America safe and keeping our military strong,” said Women Vote Trump Co-founder Amy Kremer.

Kremer called Roy a “principled conservative with strong grassroots support.”

Roy served as Cruz’s chief of staff in the early years of his time in the Senate. He subsequently joined Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s staff as his first assistant. Previously Roy served as a federal prosecutor. He has also served under Senator John Cornyn and as an advisor to Rick Perry during Perry’s term as Governor of Texas.

Cruz endorsed Roy for the seat in December.

Kremer said of Roy:

Not only will he stand on principle and fight on the issues, he will also stand up to GOP Leadership when they attempt to whittle away our constitutional rights. I’ve been in the trenches fighting before with Chip and I know he will not back down or waiver on his convictions or principles. He is one of the most principled people I’ve met while working in politics and he is exactly what we need in DC.

Roy won’t have an extended learning curve according to Kremer, “he can get to work right away because he knows how DC works and he already has the relationships.” She suggested that Roy will fight for and be a help to President Donald Trump in getting the America First agenda passed.

The Women Vote Trump co-founder recalled traveling to campaign over six years for Cruz’s first Senate election win. Kremer said, “Chip Roy is cut from the same cloth as Ted Cruz” and that he will be the “Ted Cruz of the House.” She billed Roy as a backup force to conservative Reps. Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows.

John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinderHaving never fully recovered from the humiliating and shocking electoral defeat at the hands of political neophyte Donald Trump over a year ago, the Deep State and establishment media set to work immediately to reverse that intolerable outcome by weaving a patently ludicrous “Russia conspiracy” narrative about the shoestring campaign that took them all to the cleaners.

Now that this narrative, and the corrupt investigation it engendered, is collapsing around their ears — with more and more attention being devoted to the very real collusion between our intelligence agencies, Democratic operatives, and Big Media to bring down this presidency — the establishment is quickly pivoting to another tack: attacking the “credentials” of Trump loyalists within the administration in an attempt to block a presidential policy agenda that they regard with abhorrence.

Make no mistake: the DC policy establishment, right and left alike, are well aware that they are facing the very real prospect of the collapse of their carefully nurtured policy priorities of the last three decades if President Trump carries through on the agenda he ran on, and they are determined not to let that happen. After all, their own long-standing policy preferences — for war, free trade uber alles at the expense of American workers and communities, and unlimited immigration — would have been perfectly safe under any other Administration, be it Republican or Democrat, Clinton or Bush. So why let this gatecrasher ruin the party, if it can be prevented?

Since the project of protecting their inside-the-Beltway agenda priorities through the subversion of Deep State careerists in executive agencies has only met with limited success, the establishment cabal have turned their sights on political appointees loyal to Trump. Second-tier political appointees, duly chosen by the president and faithfully executing his priorities throughout the administration, are now facing an orchestrated campaign designed to frustrate the Trump agenda by questioning their qualifications for the positions they hold. Recent examples of Trumpites on the establishment hit-list include Taylor Weyeneth at the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and Payne Griffin at Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), loyal vets of Trump’s insurgent campaign who have been very effective at carrying out the President’s mandate at their respective agencies.

The thinly-sourced, poorly documented stories emanating from the mainstream media about their lack of credentials for the positions they hold constitute an unprecedented and dangerous tactic on the part of a partisan press and their Democratic allies: going after policies they oppose by targeting personnel that have proved themselves exceptionally effective in implementing those policies.

Apparently, a Democratic opposition research group, American Bridge, has been using the Freedom of Information Act to obtain the resumes and pay grades of Trump appointees and feeding the information to allies in the media in a coordinated effort to oust young members of the administration loyal to the President and faithfully executing his orders. The Obama and Bush administrations were filled with hundreds of young, zealous campaign vets whose chief qualification for their position of authority was their loyalty to the sitting President and his agenda, and no one blinked an eye. That is, after all, as it should be: unqualified (a.k.a. uncorrupted) advocates of the stated will of the majority are precisely the people our founders envisioned calling the policy shots in our representative democracy.

In this case, Weyeneth and Griffin are treading on establishment feet by implementing policy priorities in trade and regulation that challenge powerful business interests in both parties. USTR has recently been the bane of globalists with an interest in bolstering or maintaining the status quo on bad trade deals that leave American workers in the dust but pad their own bottom lines. ONDCP meanwhile, in compiling their opioid report, sidelined Big Pharma in favor of hearing from those without a vested interest in maintaining the failed status quo.

It’s clear that the targeting of lower level personnel is a surrogate battle by means of which a policy establishment with a vested interest in preserving the status quo is fighting to neutralize an agenda that threatens those interests.

But there should be no confusion about the fact that this is a surrogate policy battle, not a legitimate concern about job qualifications of political appointees. Unless the administration (in particular the Office of Presidential Personnel) defends the loyal soldiers for President Trump’s agenda now under concerted attack, the effort to purge the true Trumpites from the agencies will gather steam. The fact of the matter is that the President can appoint whoever he likes, and if the DC establishment doesn’t like it, they’d better start learning how to win national elections. Trump needs more loyalists like Taylor Weyeneth and Payne Griffin to fight for his priorities, or those priorities will be subsumed by an establishment Swamp determined to frustrate him at every turn.

Robert Wasinger served in senior advisory and liaison roles in President Trump’s campaign and transition team, after extensive experience on Capitol Hill.On this weekend’s broadcast of “Fox News Sunday,” conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh argued President Donald Trump should not say he was vindicated after the Department of Justice handed down indictments against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian groups for meddling in the 2016 presidential election because it could “validate this whole investigation.”

Limbaugh said, “I would be very careful if I were President Trump, here.”

He continued, “The danger for the president is – it would be very, I think, seductive for him to embrace this totally embrace this – ‘see see I’ve been vindicated,’ The worst thing he can do in his world is to validate this whole investigation by claiming victory here because what if down the road, there is another indictment or a series of indictments that do name Trump or do name the Russians and Trump campaign colluding.”

He added, “That’s what this is about. This is about getting Trump. This whole thing is about setting Trump up for impeachment if the Democrats when back in 2018. Donald Trump remains in the crosshairs. He is the target, and there is no let up in that. No matter what the indictment does or doesn’t say.”

Kelly said, “I would not say that Putin likes Trump. I did not glean that at all from him. I do think — I did glean that perhaps he has something on Donald Trump. And if you watch the special tonight, you’ll see perhaps what that might be. Because we’ve done a lot of research. It’s not just Vladimir Putin tonight. It’s a lot of experts who understand Putin and Trump and the relationship between the two. And so, when I was asking him, why do you think Donald Trump never says anything unkind about you ever? I think it’s more than just he admires this Russian strongman, Chris. I think there’s a very good chance Putin knows some things about Donald Trump that Mr. Trump does not want repeated publicly.”

She added that she doesn’t think Putin has anything on Trump related to the Steele Dossier, and “[J]ust having done the research we did for this piece and this investigative report, I think it has to do with money, and Trump’s early years dealing with the Russians back in the ’90s, his facilities here in the United States.”

“I think it’s terrible, you want to know the truth, I think it’s a disgrace what’s going on in this country … a lot of people should be ashamed,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.

The president kept his statements vague and did not call out any specific names of people in the Justice Department or political figures.

Trump distanced himself from the release of the memo, saying it was ultimately up to Congress to decide what to do with the document.

“Whatever they do is fine, it was declassified, and we’ll see what happens,” he said. “A lot of people should be ashamed.”

Trump ignored questions about whether or not he supported FBI officials mentioned in the memo.

“When you look at that and you see that and so many other things, what’s going on, a lot of people should be ashamed of themselves,” he said.Omarosa Manigault, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, attacked her former boss and his White House in an upcoming episode of Big Brother: Celebrity Edition, saying she was “haunted by [Trump’s] tweets every single day.”

After departing from the Trump administration, Omarosa — a loyalist to the populist president — joined the cast of the reality television show and in a new clip for the series badmouthed her former boss, saying that the country is “going to not be okay.”

ROSS MATTHEWS: And from the outside, can I tell you as a voter and a citizen, I never got it, why you went to the White House with him. OMAROSA: I felt like it was like a call of duty. I felt like I was serving my country, not serving him. Whenever I’m accepting a political appointment it was always about the country. Like I was haunted by tweets every single day. Like what is he going to tweet next? ROSS MATTHEWS: Does anybody say to him ‘What, what’re you doing?’ OMAROSA: I mean I tried to be that person and then all of the people around him attacked me. It was like ‘Keep her away. Don’t give her access. Don’t let her talk to him.’ And it’s like Ivanka’s there, Jared’s there. And it’s… ROSS MATTHEWS: Who has that power to say ‘What’s going on?’ OMAROSA: I don’t know. I’m not there. It’s not my… it’s not my circus, it’s not my monkeys. You know I’d like to say not my problem, but I can’t say that because like it’s bad. ROSS MATTHEWS: Should we be worried? OMAROSA: [Nods head] ROSS MATTHEWS: Don’t say that because we are worried but I need you to say ‘No, it’s going to be okay.’ OMAROSA: No, it’s going to not be okay. It’s not. It’s so bad.

Omarosa, who served as communications director for the Office of Public Liaison, previously complained to the mainstream media after leaving the Trump administration last December that she was “upset” by particular instances inside the White House, as Breitbart News reported.

“There were a lot of things that I observed during the last year that I was very unhappy with, that I was very uncomfortable with, things that I observed, that I heard, that I listened to,” Omarosa said at the time.

“I can’t expand upon it because I have to go back and work with these individuals,” Omarosa continued. “But when I have a chance to tell my story, quite a story to tell, as the only African American woman in this White House, as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable, that have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and my people. And when I can tell my story, it is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.”

The White House fired back at Omarosa on Thursday, with White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah telling reporters “Omarosa was fired three times on ‘The Apprentice,’ and this is the fourth time we let her go.

Graham’s remains were brought to the rotunda to lie in honor for the ceremony where House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and Trump each delivered a short tribute.

“He felt a great passion for those that were neglected,” Trump said. “Everywhere he went, Reverend Graham delivered the same beautiful message, God loves you.”

Trump recalled that his father took him as a boy to attend one of Graham’s prayer rallies at Yankee Stadium in New York City.

“It was something very special,” Trump said. “Fred Trump was a big fan, Fred Trump was my father.”

The president pointed out that despite preaching around the globe, his son told him that Graham’s heart was always in America.

“We can only imagine the number of lives touched by the preaching and the prayers of Billy Graham, the hearts he changed, the sorrows he eased and the joy he brought to so many,” Trump said.

Trump pointed to artwork in the rotunda highlighting the country’s religious roots.

“Here in this room we are reminded that America is a nation sustained by prayer,” he said. “Today we say a prayer for our country that all across this land the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.”

Graham is only the fourth private citizen honored in the rotunda — an honor usually reserved for prominent United States political figures. Capitol Police officers Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson were extended the honor after they were killed in the line of duty as well as civil rights leader Rosa Parks.Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney took to Twitter on Monday morning to attack President Donald Trump, using the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to suggest that Trump is a racist.

Romney wrote: “The poverty of an aspiring immigrant’s nation of origin is as irrelevant as their race. The sentiment attributed to POTUS is inconsistent w/ America’s history and antithetical to American values. May our memory of Dr. King buoy our hope for unity, greatness, & ‘charity for all.'”

The former Massachusetts governor was referring to allegations that President Trump had referred to “shithole countries” in a negotiation over immigration policy in the Oval Office last Thursday with a small group of Senators that included Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL).

Trump has denied using that term, and Sens. Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Frank Purdue (R-GA) have denied hearing it, as has Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who was also present.

The White House said that President Trump was arguing for a merit-based system of immigration policy, as opposed to the existing policies of “chain migration” and the “diversity visa” lottery.

The president was also reportedly defending his administration’s decision to send some El Salvadorans and Haitians, who are in the U.S. due to earthquake disasters, back to their countries of origin after their temporary protected status expires.

Democrats have also used the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to attack Trump, based on the recent controversy and on past claims that he is a racist.

Speculation has mounted whether Romney would be a friend or foe of President Trump if elected to the Senate.

Romney has a rocky relationship with President Trump. In March 2016, he viciously attacked Trump in a speech in Salt Lake City, Utah — but stopped short of endorsing a rival candidate in the Republican primary. He mended fences with Trump when he aspired to become Secretary of State in the new administration, but has since re-emerged as one of the president’s leading GOP critics, appealing to the remnant of the “NeverTrump” movement.

Last summer, Romney criticized President Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, accusing him of moral equivalence between neo-Nazis and those opposing “racism and bigotry” — but without noting that the latter had disrupted a lawful, permitted protest.

Democrats accused Romney himself of racism when he ran for president in 2012, particularly when he accused Barack Obama supporters of voting for “free stuff,” and when he joked that “no one’s ever asked to see my birth certificate.”

During an appearance on CNN’s “New Day,” Funk was asked if President Trump took any calls while on the course.

“No, it was all golf. He was fully in the moment and with us. We played with two other guys and he was great with them too,” Funk said.

According to The Hill, “Trump on Monday returned from his Mar-a-Lago club, where he spent the Christmas and New Year’s holidays with his family. The president had arrived at what he has dubbed “the winter White House” on Dec. 22.

“The president visited the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla., for seven straight days, capping off his final visit to the club on New Year’s Day:”

But now Governor Jerry Brown wants President Donald Trump to exempt the Golden State from a new offshore drilling plan.

Gov. Brown and Attorney General Xavier Becerra have fought nearly every single major Trump administration policy, and have held out California’s liberal policies as an alternative model for America to follow. The state is even considering converting state taxes into charitable contributions for wealthy taxpayers to avoid Trump’s new tax reforms, which cap state ant local tax (SALT) deductions at $10,000.

California Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff has been a leading voice pushing theories of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign — and a suspected source for mainstream media stories about congressional investigations.

And California Democrats are also leading calls for Trump’s impeachment, with billionaire Tom Steyer plowing tens of millions of dollars into the effort.

Through all of those fights, the Trump administration has delivered federal aid to California where needed, as in the flooding and fires of 2017.

But now Brown and his administration want special treatment — the same favor that was bestowed upon Republican-led Florida earlier this week, when Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced that the Sunshine State would be exempt from a new policy proposal to open oil and gas drilling and exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf.

“We’re certainly going to ask for that. They’ve set the precedent in Florida and we’ll try to get” the exemption, Brown told a press conference Wednesday, according to the Sacramento Bee.

Other California leaders, such as Becerra, also weighed in.

.@SecretaryZinke: California is also “unique” & our “coasts are heavily reliant on tourism as an economic driver.” Our “local and state voice” is firmly opposed to any and all offshore drilling. If that’s your standard, we, too, should be removed from your list. Immediately. https://t.co/T6W6JaPCPh — Xavier Becerra (@AGBecerra) January 10, 2018

California’s state government has opposed offshore drilling for nearly 50 years, despite the presence of lucrative fossil fuel deposits, following an oil spill off the coast of Santa Barbara in 1969.

Republican Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has also asked Trump to exempt his state.

Schmidt at the New York Times reported a new raft of stories involving the early Trump administration’s handling of the Russia investigation Thursday.

The first major category of reporting cites various anonymous sources relaying accounts of the president making remarks or engaging in actions last Spring that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team find suspicious. For example, the report claims:

Mr. Mueller has also been examining a false statement that the president reportedly dictated on Air Force One in July in response to an article in The Times about a meeting that Trump campaign officials had with Russians in 2016. A new book, “Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,” by Michael Wolff, says that the president’s lawyers believed that the statement was “an explicit attempt to throw sand into the investigation’s gears,” and that it led one of Mr. Trump’s spokesmen to quit because he believed it was obstruction of justice. […] Legal experts said that of the two primary issues Mr. Mueller appears to be investigating — whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice while in office and whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia — there is currently a larger body of public evidence tying the president to a possible crime of obstruction.

Another story has President Trump “stewing” with White House Advisers Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller before deciding to fire FBI Director James Comey after his May testimony before Congress, at which time he refused to deny the president was under investigation.

The second major focus of the article is the alleged pressure the president and others in the administration put on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to not recuse himself from investigations involving Russian interference in the 2016 presidential race. White House Counsel Don McGahn is alleged to have been given a direct order from Trump to stop the recusal.

The Times then claims Sessions himself is implicated in a February effort to “undermine” Comey:

Two days after Mr. Comey’s testimony, an aide to Mr. Sessions approached a Capitol Hill staff member asking whether the staffer had any derogatory information about the F.B.I. director. The attorney general wanted one negative article a day in the news media about Mr. Comey, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. A Justice Department spokeswoman said the episode did not occur. “This did not happen and would not happen,” said the spokeswoman, Sarah Isgur Flores. “Plain and simple.”

Finally, Sessions is alleged to have unsuccessfully tendered his resignation in the wake of a dressing down in the Oval Office after Mueller’s appointment.First Lady Melania Trump and President Donald Trump were strolling across the White House lawn to board Marine One on Monday when the first lady stumbled, according to a video of the couple boarding the helicopter.

The video showed the president, thinking on his feet, wrapping his arm around his wife to break what could have been a catastrophic fall to the ground.

The two quickly embraced one another as they walked towards the steps leading to the helicopter.

Both the president and the first lady were on their way to Manchester, New Hampshire, on Monday to address the nation’s opioid crisis.

Melania has also been stepping up her public profile as first lady in recent weeks. She is scheduled to meet with major American technology companies this week to address cyberbullying and social media exposure among children.

The first lady also spoke with the spouses of the nation’s governors at the White House in late February, announcing her support for the teens speaking out after the Parkland, Florida, shooting that killed 17 people on February 14.President Donald Trump joked that he would advise his 25-year-old self not to run for president during a panel with millennial activists on Thursday.

Trump made his remarks during a panel discussion with Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk, who asked him to give advice to the 25-year-old “Donald Trump” in the audience.

“Don’t run for president,” Trump replied with a grin.

“We’re glad you did,” replied Kirk as the room applauded.

Trump said that he had a very successful business career and great press until he decided to run for office.

He said his experience in running for office proved that the media was biased.

“There’s a lot of fake news out there … I’m proud of the fact that I exposed it to a large extent,” Trump said.

He clarified that not all reporters were “fake news” but that a lot of them were.

“People have found out how dishonest it is. However you have some great, great reporters, you have some great people in the press, people that I have tremendous respect for.”"Yes, I would," President Trump says when asked if he would like to testify before Special Counsel Mueller; follows resignation today of a top Trump attorney in the Russia investigation. https://t.co/OO4bjOcFn0 pic.twitter.com/rvcLzLjUMCRep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), who has repeatedly called President Donald Trump a racist and vowed to get Trump impeached, received the “National Unity Award” at Sunday’s Martin and Coretta King Unity Breakfast in Selma, Alabama.

According to the Selma Times-Journal, the award goes to “someone special who has gone the extra mile to make a difference in the world for his or her race.” The breakfast kicked off the Selma Bridge Crossing Jubilee event that commemorates “Bloody Sunday” on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

Waters on Sunday again accused Trump of being a racist, this time for reportedly saying that Waters needs to “take an IQ test” at the Gridiron Dinner on Saturday evening. While mocking Waters’ outrageous comments, “impeach 45” chants, and other shenanigans, Trump reportedly said:

How about that one? Maxine Waters, ‘He must be impeached!’ That’s all she knows how to say, ‘He must be impeached!’ Impeached! … But he’s done nothing wrong. Doesn’t matter, they say. What has he done wrong? ‘I don’t know! You got to be impeached!’ … And then I say … I get in trouble for this, ‘She has to immediately, take an IQ test.’ And people go crazy.

Trump then reportedly said that there is “so much hatred” on the anti-Trump left that must be stopped.

Waters told MSNBC on Sunday that Trump made some “racist remarks” about her, just as she had expected.

“This president has been called stupid, he has been called ignorant, and even his Secretary of State did not deny that he called him a moron. And so he has no credibility. He has been name calling. He’s been saying all kinds of things. And I certainly expected him to come out with some racist remarks about me,” Waters said. “So he did exactly what I expected him do. And, by the way, I’m told he wasn’t funny at all.”

Trump ordered tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and ten percent on aluminum imports as a measure to save U.S. production of the metals. Trump made the move under section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 after extensive Department of Commerce research into the issue. The tariffs are being imposed on the basis of economic and national security.

Flake was swift to declare his active resistance to the tariffs:

These so-called ‘flexible tariffs’ are a marriage of two lethal poisons to economic growth – protectionism and uncertainty. Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster. I will immediately draft and introduce legislation to nullify these tariffs, and I urge my colleagues to pass it before this exercise in protectionism inflicts any more damage on the economy.

Trump spoke of imposing tariffs during his 2016 presidential campaign.

During a June 2016 Pittsburgh campaign speech, Trump called out China specifically over “theft of American trade secrets” and vowed to remedy trade disputes with tariffs. He specifically cited section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which he used to impose the tariffs on Thursday.

The United States has lost six aluminum smelters since 2013, leaving just five, according to one senior administration official. Of those five, only two are operating at full capacity, and just one produces military grade high purity aluminum. That official stated that if the one military grade producing smelter were to shut down, the U.S. would be forced to buy this material from China or the Middle East. The official called it a significant vulnerability for the U.S. The steel industry has lost an estimated 50,000 jobs since 2000, according to the official.

“We don’t make films like ‘Call Me by Your Name’ for money. We make them to upset Mike Pence.”

“None other than President Trump called Get Out the best first three-quarters of a movie he’s seen this year.”

“If the last two years have taught us anything, it’s that reality can be depressing, but tonight’s nominated documentaries show us where there is darkness, there is also hope, except at the White House. Hope Hicks quit on Wednesday.”

“Well, now at least we know Putin didn’t rig this competition, right?”President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greeted Israel Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, at the White House paying homage to not only her famous ice blue Inauguration Day ensemble but also the nation of Israel.

Mrs. Trump was all class in a laid back Max Mara coat in pale, ice blue — similar to her monochromatic Inauguration Day look — and metallic (Gasp!) ice blue Christian Louboutin stilettos. Mrs. Trump coordinated perfectly with Mrs. Netanyahu as the two walked together throughout the White House, each in a shade of blue.

Mrs. Trump is definitely having her shades of cool moment in this beautifully colored ensemble. Refined and yet relaxed.

On her feet, Mrs. Trump brought in a pop of color, wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos that featured bright red snakeskin motif to tie in the small red check on trousers. To top the look off, Mrs. Trump threw on a pair of chunky black sunglasses.

John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder.A review of the finances of a political action group sold as an anti-Trump “resistance” operation alleges that its leaders used donor money to line their own pockets instead of using it to “resist” Trump.

The report released by the law blog “Law and Crime” alleges that former Obama operative Scott Dworkin, Democrat Party PR man Jarad Geldner, and liberal activist Nathan Lerner awarded themselves “consulting fees” amounting to tens of thousands of dollars donors gave to them to fight against President Donald Trump’s policies.

At the center of the accusations is a Super PAC labeled the Democratic Coalition Against Trump (DCAT). The operation is headed by Nathan Lerner and former Joe Biden operative Jon Cooper. Former Obama operative Scott Dworkin is listed as a “senior advisor” and is also one of the PAC’s founders. Jerad Geldner is also listed as another “senior advisor” for DCAT.

On its website, DCAT describes itself this way:

[DCAT] was formed in the Spring of 2016 with the main goal of making sure that Donald Trump never became President. DCAT now exists to hold the Trump White House accountable, and is directly countering Donald Trump, along with Republican elected officials and candidates who support him, through aggressive digital and traditional advertising, grassroots action, in-depth opposition research, and a nationwide rapid-response team.

That may be how Lerner, Cooper, Geldner, and Dworkin sell DCAT to Trump-hating donors, but according to Colin Kalmbacher, the reality seems to be a bit different.

“According to OpenSecrets and Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, DCAT has taken in $221,848 in individual contributions so far for the 2017-2018 election cycle,” Kalmbacher wrote. “Of that amount, $210,074 has been spent.”

So, where did all those hundreds of thousands of donor dollars go? For one, Dworkin, who worked on Obama’s 2009 inaugural committee and was the Deputy Director for the Democratic National Convention Committee in Charlotte in 2012, seems to have gotten quite a payday while working for DCAT.

Dworkin is apparently the biggest recipient of those donations. Even as he is one of DCAT’s “senior advisors,” Dworkin also runs Bulldog Finance Group, and that entity has taken a ton of DCAT’s cash, billing the group for “consulting” and “fundraising” fees.

“During the 2016 election cycle, The Bulldog Finance Group was paid $52,877 by DCAT–out of $119,300 total raised. During the 2017-2018 election cycle, Dworkin paid his own business $79,500,” Law and Crime reported.

Some critics have called Dworkin’s big fees a “personal payday” obtained by running a “grift” on the donors.

Dworkin is not the only “consultant” rolling in donor cash. DCAT “senior advisor” Jarad Geldner also raked in a big payday right out of the donor money pot. He was paid $18,500 for “consulting” fees.

“Senior advisor” Nathan Lerner also “consulted” DCAT to the tune of $30,528 in donor funds.

Law and Order isn’t the only site that has found the expenditures questionable. A left-wing blog called Progressive Army also outed these “consultants” for taking so much of their donor’s money.

Naturally, neither of the “consultants” accused of essentially defrauding donors made any public comments about the charges.

Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.Media mogul Rupert Murdoch called President Donald Trump a “fucking moron,” according to author Michael Wolff’s much-hyped White House tell-all Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.

The Murdoch comment came at a point in Wolff’s 22-chapter book in which he describes what he says were President Trump’s “daily after-dinner phone calls to his billionaire friends about the disloyalty and incompetence around him.”

“One of these frequent callers was Rupert Murdoch, who before the election had only ever expressed contempt for Trump,” Wolff writes in an extracted Hollywood Reporter article about his new book.

“Now Murdoch constantly sought him out, but to his own colleagues, friends and family, continued to derisively ridicule Trump: ‘What a fucking moron,’ said Murdoch after one call,” Wolff writes.

Wolff’s book — which went on sale Friday ahead of its planned January 9 release — has rocked and dominated the political and media worlds from Washington D.C. to New York. The tome’s accuracy, however, has been widely panned; Wolff even admits early on that “looseness with the truth” is an “elemental thread of the book.”

Wolff says he gathered material for his new book for over 18 months and was given exclusive access to the West Wing, receiving access to the White House less than 20 times since Trump’s inauguration.

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson“My opposition to Donald Trump was wrong,” said Dennis Prager, describing Donald Trump as a “great president” whose political successes are connected to a disregard for the left-wing and partisan Democrat news media narratives.

Prager’s comments came during Thursday’s episode of his eponymous radio show. While Prager has said that Trump was his last choice during the Republican primaries, he supported him vigorously in the general election against Hillary Clinton.

“The only way to govern [while advancing] the principles of conservatism,” said Prager, was to disregard left-wing and partisan Democrat agitation pushed across the news media landscape. Prager said:

I was wrong. My opposition to Donald Trump was wrong, in retrospect. I was wrong. I had friends who supported him, and I didn’t understand them. I said, “Are you not aware of what he said about John McCain? Isn’t that enough to disqualify the guy?” They perceived in him what I did not perceive in him, that these over-the-top statements – as objectionable as the statements themselves may be, and none of them defended the statements – nevertheless, what they perceived was accurate: a man who doesn’t give a damn about what the press says about him. That is the only way to govern. It is the only way to advance the principles of conservatism in the United States is to not give a damn.

“[Donald Trump] is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made,” said Prager, describing Romney as “tepid” and concerned with appealing to news media outlets such as The New York Times.

A president’s actions are a more important metric of presidential success than a president’s demeanor, said Prager:

Would I like Donald Trump to have Mitt Romney’s temperament, or for that matter Barack Obama’s temperament? Yeah. So what? I would like a whole host of things. People are packages. What a president does is more important to me than a president’s demeanor. He is so much better a president than Mitt Romney would’ve made. Mitt Romney would’ve awakened every day to read The New York Times editorial page to see how he’s covered. Mitt Romney gave us Romneycare in Massachusetts. I campaigned for Mitt Romney, he would’ve been a better president [than Barack Obama]. Any Republican is better than any Democrat, that’s just the way it is. Having said that, Romney would’ve been a tepid president. Nothing comparably conservative compared to Donald Trump.

Concerns with a president’s demeanor should be secondary to broader analyses of a president’s impact, said Prager.

“He has turned out to be a great president with big communication flaws, in the way he tweets and some of the things he says and his temperament,” said Prager. “My temperament is the opposite. I love dignity. I love understatement. Okay, so be it. So what? I’m not sure I’d be as good a president as he. How do you like that? That’s how good he’s been.”

LISTEN:



In April of 2017, Prager invited ostensibly conservative NeverTrump news media figures to celebrate Trump’s presidency. “Do conservatives — or non-leftists, for that matter — appreciate just how terrific Donald Trump has been as president?” he asked. “And how lucky we are that he won the presidency?”

“What I do know is that they ought to be deeply appreciative of him, and deeply grateful for luck or providence, and certainly for Trump himself, that he was elected president,” continued Prager. “First, it is unlikely that any other Republican would have defeated Hillary Clinton. Second, he has not only surpassed many of our expectations but also thus far governed in a manner more consistent with conservative principles than any president since Ronald Reagan, and arguably Calvin Coolidge.”

Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter.Michael Wolff, author of the bestselling Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, told the BBC on Saturday that his book will “end this presidency” and force President Donald Trump out of office.

“The story that I’ve told seems to present this presidency in such a way that it says he can’t do his job, the emperor has no clothes. And suddenly, everywhere, people are going ‘Oh my God, it’s true, he has no clothes.’ That’s the background to the perception and the understanding that will finally end this — that will end this presidency,” Wolff said.

Wolff’s comments to the BBC reinforce what he told NBC’s Today show on Friday morning, when he said that his book shows that Trump “cannot do this job.”

He told the BBC that his sources had concluded, “No, this man can’t function in this job as president. He may have been elected president, but that does not turn him into president.”

Wolff added: “I think he’s intellectually incapable of being President of the United States.” He also described the president as “ineffectual,” incapable of passing legislation, implementing policy, or producing regulations.

The book echoes arguments made by Democrats and NeverTrump Republicans that the president could, or should, be removed under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution (emphasis added):

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of either the principal officers of the executive departments or of such other body as Congress may by law provide, transmit to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President.

President Trump fired back on Saturday, tweeting that he was a “very stable genius.”

Trump tried, in vain, to block publication of the book on Thursday, as his lawyers sent cease-and-desist letters to Wolff and his publisher ahead of an accelerated release date on Friday. That action only propelled sales higher, as bookstores quickly sold out of print copies.

Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak.Actress Meryl Streep lashed out at Melania Trump and Ivanka Trump in a New York Times interview published Wednesday, accusing the first lady and White House senior advisor of remaining silent about sexual misconduct.

Streep, who sat down with the Times alongside actor Tom Hanks to promote their new Steven Spielberg-directed Pentagon Papers drama The Post, was asked to address why it took her several days to respond to the initial New York Times exposé about how Harvey Weinstein allegedly committed decades of sexual harassment and reached financial settlements with at least eight different women.

“I don’t want to hear about the silence of me,” Streep said, deflecting away from the criticism she’s faced. “I want to hear about the silence of Melania Trump. I want to hear from her. She has so much that’s valuable to say. And so does Ivanka. I want her to speak now.”

“I don’t have a Twitter thing or — handle, whatever. And I don’t have Facebook. I really had to think,” Streep said of the allegations against Weinstein, which were first reported on October 5. “Because it really underlined my own sense of cluelessness, and also how evil, deeply evil, and duplicitous, a person [Weinstein] was, yet such a champion of really great work.”

It took Streep four days to issue a statement about the disgraced movie producer, who she once called “God,” telling the Huffington Post “The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported.”

The actress has come under intense fire for her own perceived silence, as large posters popped up all over Los Angeles last month showing Streep alongside Weinstein with the words “#SheKnew” covering her eyes.

Actress Rose McGowan, a Weinstein accuser who also settled with the producer over assault allegations, ripped Streep and accused her of “happily” working with Weinstein for years while remaining silent about his sexual misconduct.

Streep, however, maintains that with “so many rumors” swirling around it’s hard to separate fact from fiction.

“You make movies. You think you know everything about everybody. So much gossip. You don’t know anything. People are so inscrutable on a certain level. And it’s a shock. Some of my favorite people have been brought down by this, and he’s not one of them,” she said.

Indeed, Ivanka Trump said “there’s a special place in hell” for people who prey on children — a response to allegations against Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore.

In an October 16 interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, Melania Trump said, “every assault should be taken care of in a court of law, and to accuse — no matter who it is, a man or a woman — without evidence, it’s damaging and it’s unfair.”

Streep has been a constant critic of President Donald Trump, infamously using her Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award acceptance speech at the Golden Globes last year to urge the mainstream media and Hollywood to stand up to Trump, “to hold power to account, to call to the carpet for every outrage.”

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonIn Michael Wolff’s book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, Wolff claims that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said that President Donald Trump will “sign anything we put in front of him.”

Former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon also suggested that McConnell did not want anything to do with “draining the swamp.”

Bannon reportedly said of one meeting between McConnell and then-President-elect Donald Trump:

McConnell Oh, Mitch McConnell when we first met him, I mean, he was– he was– he– he said, I think in one of the first meetings– in Trump Tower with the president– as we’re wrapping up, he basically says, “I don’t wanna hear any more of this ‘Drain the Swamp’ talk.” He says, “I can’t– I can’t hire any smart people,” because everybody’s all over him for reporting requirements and– and the pay, et cetera, and the scrutiny. You know, “You gotta back off that.” The “Drain the Swamp” thing was– is Mitch McConnell was Day One did not wanna– did not wanna go there. Wanted us to back off.

President Donald Trump rebuked the media for their obsession with the new Michael Wolff book.

Trump tweeted on Friday, “Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!”

The president also tweeted, “I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.”

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders also trashed the book as tabloid journalism.

“This book is filled with false and misleading accounts from individuals who have no access or influence with the White House,” Sanders said on Thursday.Yahoo! Sports writer Jay Busbee took issue with a recent tweet from President Trump in which Trump both supported military veterans and families and took a shot at NFL anthem protesters.

However, Busbee took criticism for his recent anti-Trump article when it appeared that he was speaking for all veterans.

Busbee, whose bio doesn’t mention any military service, took issue with the president’s recent tweet of a photo of a military wife mourning her deceased soldier husband. Trump also chided the millionaire NFL players who continue to refuse to stand at attention for the playing of the national anthem.

“So beautiful,” Trump tweeted on January 4. “Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel,” the president wrote of the photo of a wife mourning at a gravesite in Arlington National Cemetery.

So beautiful….Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel! https://t.co/tJLM1tvbvb — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2018

Along with his comment, Trump retweeted an image from September that showed support for the military.

We stand to honor those who fought and died defending the greatest nation the world has ever known. God bless our vets! #MAGA 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/Oez8pI1lzZ — CoreyJones🇺🇸 (@CoreyLMJones) September 16, 2017

The president’s tweet, though, incensed Busbee, who wrote a January 4 attack on Trump calling the original photo a “months-old meme” and regurgitating the arguments made by dozens of other sports writers that the NFL protests weren’t against the flag, the country, or our soldiers.

But Busbee’s screed didn’t sit well with Smoke Room’s Jena Greene, who started out criticizing the Yahoo writer by questioning whether the meme being “months-old” was even a valid criticism. Greene slammed Busbee for seeming to dismiss the military wife meme noting that the age of a good point doesn’t “destroy credibility.”

“Somebody tell this guy that photos don’t lose meaning just because they’re a little old,” Greene wrote.

Greene also slammed Busbee for assuming he has the moral authority to speak for veterans.

At one point in his editorial, Busbee writes, “Leaving aside the question of whether it’s appropriate to use a military widow’s grief purely for scoring political points.” But Greene wondered how Busbee felt he could speak for veterans.

“The last time I checked, Yahoo! Sports writers were not in charge of veterans,” Greene wrote. “They don’t serve veterans, and most of them sit in cozy offices sipping lattes and can’t remember the last time they thanked a veteran. Two entities are allowed to speak for veterans: the commander In Chief and veterans themselves. Donald Trump happens to be one of those things.”

Still, Busbee’s main point is that Trump is wrong to criticize the NFL for its protests saying that the players weren’t protesting the flag, the nation, or our soldiers.

“Protesting players have spoken at length about how their protests aren’t meant to dishonor the military,” Busbee wrote, “but rather to raise awareness of systemic racial inequality and police brutality.”

But the demonstrations were much more than that, according to the creator of the national anthem protest.

Colin Kaepernick himself said that his protest was against the flag and the very same country our soldiers have fought and died to protect.

“I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,” Kaepernick said in August of 2016. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”

Clearly, Kaepernick was standing against the country and not just campaigning for equal rights.

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonPresident Donald Trump spared no one in his orbit on Saturday night during a speech in which he roasted his friends, foes, former staffers, and even his wife first Melania Trump in 34 minutes on the stage.

“Another calm week at the White House,” Trump joked from the stage, mocking the intense infighting that has consumed his administration.

“We finally have it running like a fine-tuned machine,” Trump joked, per a White House pool report.

Trump joked that he was late to the dinner “because Jared couldn’t get through security,” mocking his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner’s loss of top secret security clearance because of a variety of business entanglements.

“Ivanka, you’ve got to do something!” Trump called out to his daughter, mocking her too.

Trump said that Vice President Mike Pence, who he called a “straight man,” begins every day by asking about the president he would replace if removed: “Is he impeached yet?”

He also jeered at Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a frequent target of his criticism, over Sessions’ recusal from the Russia investigation by saying Sessions recused himself from a ride to the dinner.

“I offered him a ride over and he recused himself,” Trump said. Sessions and several other cabinet and White House officials joined the president at the dinner.

Trump ridiculed “the failing New York Times,” and CNN, and then turned his jokes on former White House chief strategist and former Breitbart News executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon. He joked that CNN lost its “very best reporter” in Bannon when Bannon left the White House last year.

“That guy leaked more than the Titanic,” Trump said of Bannon.

Omarosa Manigault was not spared either. The former White House public liaison chief turned reality TV star again found herself in the president’s crosshairs after one more jab at Bannon.

“Trump went on to say people doubted him after he lost his ‘chief strategist,’” White House pool reporter Hunter Walker of Yahoo News wrote in the press pool report. “However, he joked that those same people now say, ‘somehow you’re still doing great without Omarosa.’”

“Omarosa, you’re the worst!” Trump said.

Trump also called the near-constant infighting inside his White House “exciting and invigorating” then added: “I like turnover. I like chaos. It really is good.”

At that point, he mocked not only policy adviser Stephen Miller but his wife Melania too.

“Trump then joked about who would be next to leave the White House and questioned whether it would be ‘Steve Miller or Melania,’” Walker wrote in the White House pool report. “He later referenced the #FreeMelania hashtag.”

“She’s actually having a great time,” Trump added of Melania.

Trump also roasted Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, as “crazy.”

“Man, she’s crazy, but she’s a fine woman,” Trump said of Pelosi, before bashing former Vice President Joe Biden.

“Trump also brought up ‘talk’ former Vice President Joe Biden, or as he put it, ‘Sleepy Joe,’ might run for president in 2020. Trump referenced prior comments Biden made about wanting to take him out behind a barn,” Walker wrote.

“I would kick his ass like no other. … Man, would he be easy,” President Trump said of running against Biden.

“Trump also mocked Oprah and Sen. Elizabeth Warren,” Walker added at the end of the pool report. “He once again called Warren ‘Pocahontas’ and quipped that the senator suggested he and Rex Tillerson should smoke a ‘peace pipe’ with the Koreans. Trump accused Rep. Adam Schiff of leaking to the press about the Russia probe.”Just last year, because the conspiracy theory demanded it, the media told us that then-incoming Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was a pro-Vladimir Putin stooge. Basically, the choice of Tillerson was Manchurian President Donald Trump’s way of thanking Putin for his help in defeating Hillary Clinton.

But now that Trump has fired the “pro-Putin” Tillerson, and because the conspiracy theory demands it, this very same media are now telling us that Manchurian President Trump fired him for being too tough on Putin.

Even as the media’s 18-month conspiracy about Trump’s colluding with Russia collapses into a pile of facts around their fat ankles, our utterly useless media (who were completely caught off guard by Tillerson’s firing — LOL), continue to push that conspiracy, even though it means completely contradicting their own reporting.

We will start with everyone’s favorite example: the fake news factory that is CNN…

Fast forward to Tuesday, the day of Tillerson’s firing, and here is CNN anti-Trump activist Jake Tapper suggesting Trump fired Tillerson for being anti-Putin: “The firing today came just hours after Tillerson went much farther than the White House did by joining the U.K. in pointing a finger at Russia for the brazen poison nerve agent attack against a Russian defector and his daughter on British soil.”

That same day, even though a White House personnel move of this size was obviously in the works for some time, CNN’s John Berman floated the same conspiracy theory:

You know, Admiral Kirby, to you, this comes 24 hours after the secretary of State made a statement directly in opposition to what the White House was saying. This is in response to the British — to the British prime minister condemning Russia for poisoning a spy on British grounds. The White House would not go as far as to say Russia did it. Rex Tillerson said, “We’re outraged that Russia appears to have engaged in such behavior,” and now he’s out.

Russia was already a focus of concern after the Central Intelligence Agency said the Kremlin had intervened in the American presidential election to help Mr. Trump’s candidacy. Now Mr. Tillerson’s career is igniting a debate over the blending of business and politics — and whether that could tip the scales in Russia’s favor on major policy decisions like the sanctions.

Inside Rex Tillerson’s long romance with Russia During the presidential campaign, the Trump team fought off accusations that it had direct connections with senior Russian officials and oligarchs. Now, President-elect Donald Trump has appointed as his secretary of state Rex Tillerson, a businessman who has some of the most deep and long-standing ties to the Russian political and business elite of any American.

…and now:

Did Trump fire Tillerson because he was too anti-Russia? About 13 hours before he was fired as secretary of state, Rex Tillerson issued perhaps his toughest comments to date on Russia. He said that a nerve agent used on a former Russian spy in Britain last week “clearly came from Russia.” He also called Russia “an irresponsible force of instability in the world, acting with open disregard for the sovereignty of other states and the life of their citizens.”

Missing from all this manufactured handwringing is the inconvenient fact that Tillerson’s replacement, Mike Pompeo, is very tough on Russia and has been, even as Trump’s CIA chief.

But as you can see, in their zeal to attack Trump no matter what he does, the media and its minions have stopped caring about consistency and truth — and certainly about their own credibility.

“Our power is diminishing because of this naked and phony nationalism and this populism designed to clear space for selfish people to be able to operate. So folks, I think it’s important to send Jon back, I think it’s important we win back the House of Representatives, because standing up for the middle class, dealing them back into the promise, is the challenge of our time,” Biden reportedly said at the Montana Democrats’ Mansfied-Metcalf Dinner.

Biden, who has lashed out at his own party for not understanding the concerns of working-class voters, also spoke about the diminishing middle class.

“There used to be a basic bargain in America, shared by Democrats and Republicans, that if you contributed to the success of an enterprise you worked with, you got to share in the benefits,” he reportedly added. “That’s broken, man.”

Biden’s top advisers are reportedly preparing for a 2020 presidential run and one scenario they are reportedly considering is having Biden promise to serve just one term so the country can have a “reset.”President Donald Trump commented on the dramatic gun control meeting with members of Congress on Thursday, urging them to “respect” the Second Amendment.

Despite tacit endorsement of many of the gun control proposals from Democrats in the meeting, Trump noted on Twitter that some of them were good and “some not so good” on Thursday morning.

The NRA reacted to the meeting by calling it “great TV” but “bad policy.”

“Instead of punishing law-abiding gun owners for the acts of a deranged lunatic our leaders should pass meaningful reforms that would actually prevent future tragedies,” said NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker.

On Twitter, Trump only endorsed the idea of background checks for purchasing firearms.

“Gun free zones are proven targets of killers,” Trump wrote. “After many years, a Bill should emerge. Respect 2nd Amendment!”TEL AVIV — Former Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly attempted to sabotage the Trump administration’s attempts to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, urging the Palestinian Authority not to “yield to President Trump’s demands,” and suggesting that President Donald Trump could be out of office within a year.

The report originated with Israel’s Maariv daily newspaper, and cited a senior Palestinian Authority official describing a meeting in London between Kerry and a close associate of PA President Mahmoud Abbas, Hussein Agha. Agha, who helped lead previous talks on behalf of Abbas, related the alleged details of the talk to PA officials, Maariv reported.

Citing his own newspaper, Maariv columnist Ben Caspit wrote in the Jerusalem Post:

During the conversation, according to the report, Kerry asked Agha to convey a message to Abbas and ask him to “hold on and be strong.” Tell him, he told Agha, “that he should stay strong in his spirit and play for time, that he will not break and will not yield to President [Donald] Trump’s demands.” According to Kerry, Trump will not remain in office for a long time. It was reported that Kerry said that within a year there was a good chance that Trump would not be in the White House.

A spokesman for Abbas did not immediately return a Breitbart News request seeking comment on Kerry’s alleged actions.

Fox News reported that the State Department declined to comment on the matter.

In a statement, the Republican Jewish Coalition ripped Kerry’s alleged remarks as “reckless.”

“John Kerry failed for four years as secretary of state to achieve Israeli-Palestinian peace. Now he wants a second bite of the apple, a bite the American people chose not to give him when they rejected the Obama/Kerry foreign policy in 2016,” said RJC executive director Matt Brooks.

“John Kerry is no longer a representative of the American people and his action – conducting a shadow foreign policy – is reckless and undermines the possibility of achieving peace,” he said. “The American people chose President Trump, in part, because he promised to pivot away from the failed policies of John Kerry.”

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich expressed doubt that Kerry would have made such comments.

“Kerry knows as a former secretary of state, a former U.S. senator, that kind of advice would be stunningly unpatriotic, and I don’t think John Kerry would do something like that,” Gingrich said during a segment on “Fox & Friends.” “I hope he wouldn’t. I would be very, very surprised if a former secretary of state, a former U.S. senator would have said anything that was that overtly anti-American.”

Follow him on Facebook.Christopher Steele, the ex-British spy who authored the Trump dossier, also gave the FBI a “second dossier,” written by a former journalist “who was close to the Clinton White House in the 1990s” as corroboration for the first, according to a new report.

The Guardian, a British newspaper that interviewed Steele in November, reported Tuesday that the former spy gave the FBI the memo, written by former journalist David Shearer, in October 2016 after the FBI asked him for any evidence that could be useful to its investigation.

Steele reportedly told the FBI he could not vouch for the veracity of the “Shearer memo,” but that he was giving them a copy because it corresponded with what he had separately heard from his “own independent sources.”

Like Steele’s dossier, the Shearer memo alleges that President Trump was “compromised” during a 2013 trip to Moscow that involved “lewd acts” in a hotel. And like the dossier, the Shearer memo relied on an unnamed source within the FSB, Russia’s state security service.

The Guardian said it could not verify any of the Shearer memo’s claims. According to the paper:

Unlike Steele, Shearer does not have a background in espionage, and his memo was initially viewed with scepticism, not least because he had shared it with select media organisations before the election. … Shearer is a controversial figure in Washington. Conservative outlets have accused him of being part of a ‘hatchet man’ and member of a ‘secret spy ring’ and within Clinton’s orbit. There is no evidence that the Clinton campaign was aware of the Shearer memo. But other people who know Shearer say he is not just a Democratic party hack and there is no evidence that his memo was ever sought by Clinton campaign officials. Sources say that while he lacks the precision and polish of a seasoned former spy like Steele, Shearer has also been described as having a large network of sources around the world and the independent financial means to pursue leads.

The Guardian reported it has been told by an unnamed source that the FBI is “still assessing” details in the memo and is “pursuing intriguing leads.”

“One source with knowledge of the inquiry said the fact the FBI was still working on it suggested investigators had taken an aspect of it seriously,” the report said. “It raises the possibility that parts of the Steele dossier, which has been derided by Trump’s supporters, may have been corroborated by Shearer’s research, or could still be.”

The report about the memo appeared just one day after the House intelligence committee voted to release to the public a Republican-drafted memo alleging that senior officials at the Justice Department and the FBI used the unverified Trump dossier in part to obtain a spy warrant on the Trump campaign.

Steele’s dossier and involvement in the election is controversial. He was hired the spring of 2016 by Fusion GPS, which was hired by a law firm on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, to dig up dirt on Trump.

Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson testified to congressional investigators last summer that Steele went to the FBI in late June or early July 2016 after he heard a story that Trump paid prostitutes to urinate on a hotel bed that the Obamas had slept in while on a trip to Moscow in 2013.

Simpson said Steele went to the FBI because he was so concerned that Trump could be blackmailed, and provided them with a copy of his first memo, and gave them subsequent memos. The FBI allegedly contacted Steele again in September 2016, and flew him out to Rome in October 2016 — a month before the election.

Simpson said Steele cut off contact with the FBI after a report in October 2016 that said the FBI had found no connections between the Trump campaign and Russia.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Subcommittee Chairman Lindsey Graham (R-SC) last month referred Steele for a criminal investigation. Grassley last week said they had also written a memo about Steele for public release, but the FBI has blocked it, “falsely” arguing it contains classified information.The FBI has dedicated an untold number of resources to an investigation based on the infamous, 35-page largely discredited anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion with Russia and claiming without any evidence that Donald Trump engaged in sordid sexual acts caught on video.

Yet that same dossier-obsessed FBI is now facing scrutiny for allegedly taking few actions after the agency was alerted to a YouTube comment last fall bearing the name of the future Florida school mass shooter and declaring, “Im going to be a professional school shooter.”

The FBI’s probe of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign reportedly centered on the dossier despite the bureau being fully aware that the questionable document was produced by the controversial Fusion GPS opposition political research outfit and was paid for by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee.

The Guardian recently reported that the FBI has been utilizing a second dossier in its investigation of unsubstantiated claims of collusion between Russia and Trump’s presidential campaign, this one authored by Cody Shearer, a shadowy former tabloid journalist who has long been closely associated with various Clinton scandals. National Review previously dubbed Shearer a “Creepy Clinton Confidante” and “the Strangest Character in Hillary’s Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy.”

A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority detailed the centrality of the dossier in the FBI’s probe, which has not produced any evidence of collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia.

In addition to wild accusations about meetings with Russians, Steele’s dossier infamously claimed that while Trump was staying in the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton Hotel in Moscow in 2013, the real estate mogul hired “a number of prostitutes to perform a ‘golden showers’ (urination) show in front of him.” The dossier claims that Trump wanted to “defile” the bed because he learned that President Obama had used the same suite during a trip to Russia. Those dossier claims have never been verified.

A Washington Post report last year provided a window into some of the FBI’s resources in probing alleged Russian attempts to interfere in the election. According to the newspaper, in the summer of 2016, then-CIA Director John Brennan convened a “secret task force at CIA headquarters composed of several dozen analysts and officers from the CIA, the NSA and the FBI.”

The Post reported the task force included “a team of operations specialists at the CIA, NSA and FBI who took direction from the task force on where to aim their subsequent efforts to collect more intelligence on Russia.”

It would later be revealed that Comey’s FBI utilized the dossier in three FISA court applications to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign. The surveillance operation undoubtedly drained still more FBI resources.

While the FBI was ensconced in its dossier investigation it received another tip bearing the name of the Florida school mass shooter.

Ben Bennight, a bail bondsman in Mississippi, told reporters he took a screenshot of the “Im going to be a professional school shooter” comment last fall and flagged it to Youtube, which in turn removed the offending remark. Bennight said he alerted his local FBI field office in a voice mail and was interviewed the next day by field agents.

The YouTube user name for the individual who left the eerie comment was “nikolas cruz.” Bennight said he did not hear anything further on the matter until an individual bearing the same name carried out the Parkland, Fla. school shooting, murdering 17 people in cold blood.

Rob Lasky, the FBI special agent in charge in Miami, told the New York Times the bureau was reviewing what steps were taken after the FBI received Bennight’s tip.

“There was no particular information about the particular time, location or further identifiers about the person who posted the comment,” Lasky said. “No additional information was found to positively identify the person who posted this comment. There was no connection found to South Florida.”

It was unclear which “further identifiers” would be required given that the YouTube user’s name might actually be the real name of the Florida school shooter.

Running Cruz’s name through law enforcement databases might have turned up a positive ID. According to reports, Broward County police were called to the killer’s home at least 39 times over a seven-year period.

Cross-referencing the YouTube user’s name on other social media accounts would have found similarly disturbing patterns.

Local KTLA reported:

Posts under videos on YouTube and other sites by someone using the name Nikolas Cruz include threatening comments, such as: “I whana shoot people with my AR-15.” “I wanna die Fighting killing s**t ton of people.” “I am going to kill law enforcement one day they go after the good people.”

Also an Instagram account using the name @Nikolascruzmakarov contained a profile picture of a masked individual and included posts of a collection of firearms on a bed, and a picture from the perspective of a scope looking out a window seemingly channeling a sniper.

The Times, however, reported that the FBI would have had few options even if they followed through with the tip:

Agents are still trying to sort out what happened, but without more information and limited ability under the circumstances to obtain a subpoena, their options were few. Had agents sought a grand jury subpoena to obtain data from YouTube to identify the person behind the posting, it is not certain that prosecutors would have agreed to seek one based on the scant information available. Agents might have a hard time convincing prosecutors of an imminent threat because the post mentioned no time or location of a possible shooting. Even if agents had tied Mr. Cruz to the YouTube post, the authorities probably would have questioned him or his family and friends but would have been unable seize his gun without a court order.

Though, while saying he wouldn’t visit 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Olympic skater says that he would instead like to something to support his community.

“No, I have no desire to go to the White House,” Rippon told the Daily Mail. “But I would like to do something to help my community,” he added.

The skater insisted that he would do “something positive and not just stay at home” as part of his boycott.

Rippon the said, “I have a great story. I want people to get to know me.”

Rippon helped Team USA bring home a Bronze medal in this year’s Winter Olympics at PyeongChang, South Korea, but he has placed himself at the center of constant controversy over his feelings about the Trump administration.

As the games opened, Rippon was heard loudly attacking Vice President Mike Pence who headed the U.S. delegation to the games. The Olympian called the vice president into question based on Rippon’s false assumption that Pence supported anti-gay policies — particularly a policy called “gay conversion therapy” — when he was governor of Indiana.

Despite the VP’s conciliatory replies to Rippon and his assurances that he supports all U.S. Olympians equally, Rippon continued attacking Pence throughout his time in South Korea.

In another widely reported incident, Rippon teamed with fellow gay athlete Gus Kenworthy and began posting photos to social media with a pointed message to Pence reading, “eat your heart out, Pence.”

Rippon also very publicly refused to visit with Pence after the vice president’s staff reached out to arrange a private meeting.

Even after his repeated attacks, ubiquitous anti-Trump statements, and ongoing screeds, Rippon then complained that Pence and Trump were “distracting” the Olympics team from their sport.

“NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!” the president wrote on Twitter

“POTUS wants to know everything we’re doing,” the text between the two officials read, according to Fox News, which broke the story. The text was sent on September 2, 2016, days before President Obama met with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Later the president said that he told Putin to “cut it out” during a discussion on hacking activities from Russia.

Since then, Fox News has been playing the story on a loop and it appears to have caught the president’s eye.Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) claimed he was being “constructive” when he lashed out at President Donald Trump, calling Trump a “psychopath” over the weekend after Trump blamed the FBI for failing to prevent the Florida school shooting.

“I think it’s very important for us to shock the American public, especially those that aren’t paying attention to what this president is doing,” he said during a Wednesday CNN appearance. “I think it is constructive in that sense, that we’re not dealing with a normal president.”

Gallego, who also tweeted America would regret the day Trump was born, added that “if any president in the past would have tweeted this out while there were still young men and women being buried in a mass shooting, the press and politicians in general would have started questioning the sanity of this president or whether even he’s fit for office.”

“Somehow, we’ve all gone into the norm that the president can act how he is and we’re supposed to accept it’s normal. It’s not normal,” he added. “Everything the White House is doing is not normal. And it is incumbent upon elected officials like me to try to get people to recognize that.”

Gallego continued to say that Trump’s tweet was “not normal” and elected officials needed to call him out on it.

“What he did was beyond the pale. To take something as disgusting that just occurred to these young kids and then turn around and make it about himself,” Gallego said. “That’s not normal. We need to fight on all fronts for people to realize that.”More Brits support than oppose United States President Donald J. Trump being welcomed in a full state visit to the United Kingdom, new polling shows.

Despite threats of protests in London from left-wing groups and repeated messages from London’s Labour mayor Sadiq Khan that he did not want President Trump to visit the UK, the latest YouGov poll found the numbers supporting an official welcome was rising. In all, a plurality now again supports a visit, with 45 per cent in favour, 39 per cent against, and the remainder undecided.

A plurality of Brits once again support a Trump state visit – 45% think a Trump state visit should go ahead, while 39% think it should be cancelled https://t.co/WoYmZGZQDZ pic.twitter.com/78pEAR2T3L — YouGov (@YouGov) February 6, 2018

The poll was first taken in January 2017, when UK Prime Minister Theresa May travelled to Washington, DC, to meet with President Trump, extending an invitation for a state dinner. The president and PM May were even seen holding hands around the White House — at that time support for a state visit stood around 50 per cent.

Support subsequently fluctuated, with two polls in September and December 2017 showing opposition leading. Yet that position has now been reversed with positive views rising by some 14 per cent in just two months.

In other research that accompanied the new figures, pollsters YouGov stated this rising support for a state visit — symbolic of a strong and persisting relationship between the UK and U.S. — was born of a deep pragmatism among British people. While 97 per cent of Brits who think President Trump is doing a good job also supported him coming to the UK, some 75 per cent of people who thought the president was merely doing an average job still wanted the visit to go ahead.

This contrasted with the just nine per cent of Brits who did not like President Trump at all still supporting a state visit, despite their personal beliefs.

On February 21, Breitbart News reported Trump’s suggestion that arming teachers is key to ridding schools of their gun-free appeal to attackers. CNN quoted Trump saying, “Gun-free zone to a maniac—because they’re all cowards—a gun-free zone is ‘let’s go in and let’s attack because bullets aren’t coming back at us.’”

He argued that the scenario changes if teachers can shoot back.

Trump reiterated his position on Thursday, noting that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes away,” but teachers can shoot sickos “immediately.”

CBS News now indicates that Trump has upped the ante by saying armed teachers should get “a bonus.” Even then, he noted, arming teachers would be “much less expensive than the guards.”

Trump believes that once school teachers are armed, the safety of students will be greatly improved. He said, “You come into our schools you’re gonna be dead. And it’s gonna be fast.”

The context for Trump’s remarks was the administration’s announcement earlier in the day that it was suspending $255 million in aid to Pakistan because of that government’s alleged “double game” on terrorism.

“They work with us at times, and they also harbor the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan,” UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said to reporters, according to Reuters. “That game is not acceptable to this administration. We expect far more cooperation from Pakistan in the fight against terrorism.”

Trump later tweeted:

As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect. They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

…peace treaty with Israel. We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more. But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2018

UN Ambassador Nikki Haley said Tuesday that the Trump administration would be withholding funds for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), a special refugee program that only deals with Palestinians, until the Palestinian leaders came back to the negotiating table.

“[President Trump] doesn’t want to give any additional funding until the Palestinians agree to come back to the negotiation table, and what we saw with the resolution [on Jerusalem] was not helpful to the situation,” she told reporters.

President Trump has already signaled his support for the Taylor Force Act, which passed the House last month and would cut some U.S. funds to the Palestinian Authority as long as it continues to pay stipends to Palestinian terrorists in Israeli prisons and the families of dead Palestinian terrorists.

The Palestinian Authority has been sharply critical of the Trump administration since the president’s decision last month to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and to move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

This article has been updated to include the Trump administration’s withholding of UNRWA funding.

“A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago,” Trump said. “Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security cameras running?”

Crooks’s story is not new. Her accusations first surfaced during the presidential election when she spoke to the New York Times about her story, she participated in a press conference with Gloria Allred, and she joined a press conference of Trump accusers hosted by the George Soros funded left-wing documentary group Brave New Films.

Now, she is running for office in Ohio for the state legislature.

The Washington Post story repeats her accusations and details some of the hate she has received online and in person since she came forward with her story, putting her photo on the front page of the print edition:

“I just want people to listen. How many women have to come forward?” she tells the Post. “What will it take to get a response?”

Trump dismissed her claims as “another false accusation.”

“Why doesn’t the Washington Post report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me?” he wrote. “One had her home mortgage paid off. Only Fox News so reported…doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative.”

Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security…… — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 20, 2018TEL AVIV — A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo released on Friday alleging abuse of surveillance authority may warrant a review of previous testimony in which former FBI Director James B. Comey admitted that he pushed back against a request from President Donald Trump to possibly investigate the origins claims made in the infamous anti-Trump dossier.

The surveillance memo, crafted by House Intelligence Committee Republicans, documents Comey signed three FISA court applications utilizing the anti-Trump dossier to conduct surveillance on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s 2016 campaign.

The memo documents that on October 21, 2016, the FBI and Justice Department sought and received the FISA order against Page, and that the agencies sought the renewal of the order every 90 days in accordance with court requirements. Renewals require separate finding of probable cause each time, the memo relates.

According to the memo, Comey “signed three FISA applications in question on behalf of the FBI, and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one.”

The memo relates the FBI utilized the anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele as evidence against Page in order to obtain the FISA warrant.

During his prepared remarks for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, delivered on June 8, 2017, Comey related that he pushed back against a suggestion from Trump to investigate the dossier claims.

The former FBI chief stated that following a January 6 Oval Office meeting with Intelligence Community leaders, Comey “remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment.”’

It is clear Comey was referring to the dossier since he writes the “salacious and unverified” material was about to be publically reported by the news media. Four days after that briefing, the dossier was published by BuzzFeed.

In his statement summarizing his conversation with Trump, Comey refers to Russian prostitutes, a key component of the dossier:

He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.

In a private White House dinner with Trump on January 27, Comey says the topic of the “salacious material” again came up and he reveals that Trump was considering asking the FBI to investigate the origins of the claims. Comey pushed back against that idea.

Comey writes:

During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn’t happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we weren’t, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it.

According to the Republican memo, the FBI and DOJ failed to inform the FISA court of the following aspects of the dossier utilized to obtain the warrant on Page:

That Steele’s Dossier was reportedly funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm. “Neither the initial application in October 2016, nor any of the renewals, disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign, or any party/campaign in funding Steele’s efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI officials,” the memo states.

That the initial application notes Steele worked for a “named U.S. person” but does not name the controversial firm Fusion GPS or its founder Glenn Simpson.

That Steele reportedly met with Yahoo News at the direction of Fusion GPS. A Yahoo News article about an alleged trip by Page to Moscow was cited in the FISA warrant, according to the memo.

Written with research by Joshua Klein.Max Boot, the Never Trump pundit and unrepentant Iraq War proponent who was recently added to the Washington Post’s roster of “conservative” opinion contributors, slammed President Donald Trump for “ignoring” what he argues is the “worst attack on America since 9/11” in his Monday column.

The “attack” to which Boot refers is Russia’s 2016 election meddling as alleged in Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment of 13 Russian nationals last week. Boot suggests President Trump’s reaction to the allegations, and the nearly 15-month media-driven frenzy over Russian “meddling” that preceded them, is equivalent to a president ignoring the September 11, 200, attacks by Islamist terrorists that killed almost 3,000 Americans.

“Imagine if, after 9/11, the president had said that the World Trade Center and Pentagon could have been attacked by ‘China’ or ‘lots of other people,’ Boot writes. “Imagine if he had dismissed claims of al-Qaida’s responsibility as a ‘hoax’ and said that he ‘really’ believed Osama bin Laden’s denials.”

The Russian scheme, with apparent links to the Russian government, is alleged to have set up social media accounts and organized street-level activism to spread discord in the 2016 election cycle at various times, supporting eventual winner Donald Trump as well as fomenting opposition to him after his victory.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein emphasized that the indictment makes no allegation the election outcome was affected.

Boot acknowledges that Russia’s “attack” did not leave anyone dead but implies a rough equivalence to the events of 9/11, explicitly describing Russia social media scheming as the “second-worst foreign attack on America in the past two decades.” “The Russian subversion of the 2016 election did not, to be sure, kill nearly 3,000 people. But its longer-term impact may be even more corrosive by undermining faith in our democracy,” Boot explains.

The Boston Marathon bombing, the San Bernardino massacre, and the Pulse Nightclub shooting, all deadly attacks committed in the name of or inspired by foreign jihadist organizations, pale in comparison by Boot’s estimation.

Boot further claims Trump’s response, denying the collusion between his campaign and the Russians of which no credible accusation has been made to this day, is “obstructionism” preventing the kind of commission that was set up after 9/11 and which Boot believes is needed to respond to Russia propaganda efforts. He argues:

The president’s obstructionism makes it impossible to appoint an 11/8 Commission to study this cyber-assault and to recommend responses. Various agencies, such as the FBI, are trying to combat the Russians on their own, but there is no coordinated response.

Boot also appears to call for government regulation of the internet as a remedy to Russian efforts. “Just as Sept. 11 made clear that private security could not safeguard the aviation system, so the 2016 Russian attack made clear that social media companies cannot safeguard the electoral system,” he writes. “A greater federal role is needed, yet Trump refuses to even admit that the problem exists.”

Since being hired on January 30 as the Washington Post’s new ostensibly “conservative” columnist, Boot has added support for broad new gun control measures and a “rethink” of the Second Amendment, continued mass immigration, and censuring House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (R-CA) to his previously confirmed positions in favor of legal abortion and “transgender” people’s use of public facilities that do not correspond to their sex, his embrace of the leftist doctrine of “white privilege,” and his admonition that the “GOP deserves to die.”President Donald Trump reacted to the shooter who is suspected of killing 17 students at a Florida high school.

“So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem.”

The suspected shooter was reportedly treated for mental problems at a local clinic and expelled from school for threatening students and demonstrating abusive behavior.

Law enforcement officials said that the shooter demonstrated “very, very disturbing” behavior on social media and the FBI was reportedly told of a comment under a YouTube account with his name about being a “professional school shooter.” The account was deleted by YouTube on Wednesday night. The shooter’s Instagram account featured images of guns, according to reports.

Before he was expelled, Former teachers and students said that the shooter was suspended in school for having bullets in his backpack and that teachers were warned that he was not allowed on campus with a backpack.

Trump urged friends and families to report problematic students to law enforcement.

“Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” he wrote.

Trump offered prayers and condolences on Twitter on Wednesday after news broke of the deadly shooting.

“My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,” he wrote. “We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.”

Wednesday’s White House press briefing was canceled after several delays and the president did not address the country after it was clear that multiple casualties occurred.

My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2018TEL AVIV — A four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority raises immediate questions about the decision by former FBI Director James Comey to brief Donald Trump and then-President Barack Obama on the contents of the infamous, largely discredited 35-page anti-Trump dossier.

The memo relates that in early January 2017, prior to Trump’s inauguration, Comey briefed then President-Elect Trump and Obama on the dossier even though months later Comey would label the dossier as containing “salacious and unverified” material.

Critically, the memo relates that, after dossier author Christopher Steele was terminated months earlier as an FBI source, a “source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele’s reporting as only minimally corroborated.” Still, Comey saw fit to brief Trump and Obama on the dossier contents.

Comey’s dossier briefing to Trump was subsequently leaked to the news media, setting in motion a flurry of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document circulated within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.

On January 10, CNN was first to report the leaked information that the controversial contents of the dossier were presented during classified briefings inside classified documents presented one week earlier to Obama and Trump.

The news network cited “multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings” – in other words, officials leaking information about classified briefings – revealing the dossier contents were included in a two-page synopsis that served as an addendum to a larger report on Russia’s alleged attempts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.

The documents were given to the politicians during the briefings delivered by Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers, the officials told CNN.

The network reported the documents state that “Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump” and contain “allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.”

Months later, Brennan made clear in May 2017 testimony that after viewing all of the evidence that was available to him on the Russia probe he is not aware of any collusion between Russia and members of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.

Just after CNN’s January 10 report on Comey’s classified briefings about the dossier, meanwhile, BuzzFeed famously published the dossier’s full unverified contents.

The New York Times used CNN’s story on Comey’s briefing to report some contents of the dossier the same day as CNN’s January 10 report on the briefings.

After citing the CNN story, the Times reported:

The memos describe sex videos involving prostitutes with Mr. Trump in a 2013 visit to a Moscow hotel. The videos were supposedly prepared as “kompromat,” or compromising material, with the possible goal of blackmailing Mr. Trump in the future. The memos also suggest that Russian officials proposed various lucrative deals, essentially as disguised bribes in order to win influence over Mr. Trump. The memos describe several purported meetings during the 2016 presidential campaign between Trump representatives and Russian officials to discuss matters of mutual interest, including the Russian hacking of the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.

Immediately following CNN’s article, National Intelligence Director Clapper added fuel to the media fire about the dossier by releasing a statement that he spoke to Trump to express “my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press” – referring to the leaks to CNN about the classified briefing. He called the leaks “extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.”

Clapper’s statement generated fresh media coverage of the dossier briefing.

Prior to CNN’s report leaking the Comey briefing to Trump, which was picked up by news agencies worldwide, the contents of the dossier had been circulating among news media outlets, but the sensational claims were largely considered too risky to publish.

All that changed when the dossier contents were presented to Obama and Trump during the classified briefings. In other words, Comey’s briefings themselves and the subsequent leak to CNN about those briefings by “multiple US officials with direct knowledge,” seem to have given the news media the opening to report on the dossier’s existence as well as allude to some of the document’s unproven claims.

In an updated version of CNN’s report, the network revealed that it had reviewed the 35-page dossier and would not report “on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations.”

CNN reported that the classified briefings to Obama and Trump demonstrated the dossier information was “credible enough” to be included in such high-level briefings:

Some of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer. What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago.

When it published the full dossier, BuzzFeed reported that the contents had circulated “for months” and were known to journalists.

The website reported, “The documents have circulated for months and acquired a kind of legendary status among journalists, lawmakers, and intelligence officials who have seen them. Mother Jones writer David Corn referred to the documents in a late October column.”

In his statement following the leaks to CNN about the dossier briefings to Obama and Trump, Clapper also said the dossier contents had been “widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it.”

It seems the news media waited for the leak about Comey’s dossier briefings first reported by CNN before publicizing on the dossier’s existence and some of its contents.

Yet in his testimony, the FBI’s Comey claimed the opposite was the case. He claimed that he and other U.S. officials briefed Obama and Trump about the dossier contents because they wanted to alert the president and president-elect that the news media were about to release the material. It is not the usual job of the U.S. intelligence community to brief top officials about pending news media coverage.

In his prepared remarks before the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 8, 2017, Comey detailed why he claimed the Intelligence Community briefed Obama and Trump on the “salacious material” – a clear reference to the dossier.

Comey wrote:

The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the President-Elect; and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing.

Yet the “unverified” dossier contents, determined to have been only “minimally corroborated” by the FBI, was still presented to Trump and Obama in a briefing subsequently leaked to the news media – a briefing that may have provided the aura of credibility to the largely discredited Russia conspiracy document.

Written with research by Joshua Klein.Ynetnews reports: US President Donald Trump is expected to present his peace plan to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict soon, The New York Times reported Monday, citing three Trump administration officials.

The White House, according to the Times, is still polishing the plan, seeking to find a formula that will ensure the American intiative is not dead on arrival. The Trump administration hopes that when the peace plan is finally put on the table, the pressure on the Palestinians to enter negotiations with Israel will increase.

According to the report, the delay in presenting the plan, which was written by Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, US Ambassador to Israel David Friedman, and adviser on Middle East affairs Jason Greenblatt, stems from two reasons: The expected Palestinians opposition to the plan and the possibility of snap elections in Israel, which will make Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wary of making any concessions out of fear of creating resentment among his voters on the Right.

Melania and her family returned to the White House late Monday night after a weekend of partying in Palm Beach, Florida at Mar-A-Lago. Melania opted for burgundy leather leggings, similar to these Helmut Lang leggings that retail for $920.

Always one to be monochromatic, Melania matched her turtleneck sweater — likely cashmere — and between $12,000 to $65,000 “Birkin” bag which is a luxury trademark of the Hermès fashion brand.

Rather than clunky boots for the cold, Melania bared her ankles in elegant Christian Louboutin stilettos, a favorite of the First Lady’s.

Trump wrote on New Year’s Eve, “Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election. People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts & more?”:

Americans continue to benefit from a robust economy with the 45th president in office. American unemployment claims stay at a record 17-year low, the lowest level since the year 2000. The American economy reached its 147th straight week that unemployment claims dipped below 300,000, which marks the longest unemployment streak since 1970.

American consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2000, according to the University of Michigan.

Retail sales also boomed 4.9 percent over the previous holiday shopping season.

President Trump and the Senate confirmed a record number of federal appeals court judges in his first year in office, beating Presidents John Kennedy and Richard Nixon’s record of 11 judges in their respective first years in office.

After President Trump signed the historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, several American corporations announced that they will invest in their employees, give their workers bonuses and wage hikes, and invest in America.

Comcast announced after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December that they will distribute $1,000 bonuses to more than one hundred thousand frontline and non-executive employees and invest more than $50 billion in infrastructure over the next several years as a result of Republicans passing tax reform.

Fellow bank Wells Fargo also revealed that they will raise their staff minimum wage to $15 an hour and would also target $400 million in donations to community and non-profit organizations next year thanks to the Republican tax bill.

AT&T announced that they will distribute more $1,000 bonuses to more than 200,000 of their employees and invest more than $1 billion next year in their domestic business.

President Donald Trump tweeted on Thursday, “Retail sales are at record numbers. We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt—and you haven’t seen anything yet!”

President Trump also tweeted on Sunday, “If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day. Now they have a great future—and just beginning!”Friday on MSNBC’s “Hardball,” host Chris Matthews said Republicans who supported Donald Trump after the release of the House Intelligence Committee memo were “goose-stepping” like North Koreans.

Matthews said, “Did you ever watch those North Koreans goose-stepping in line, the same smile on their faces, everything is de rigueur? Your Republican Party is so much like that.”

He added, “Your numbers are so totally with Trump. Nobody liked him when he ran. They all fought him—all the Bushes and Rubio, everybody’s against him. Now they march along, whatever Trump wants, they go yes, sir, yes, sir. What’s that about?”

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENThe Trump administration has reportedly suspended $125 million in aid for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), the special UN agency that deals specifically with so-called Palestinian refugees.

Barack Ravid of Israel’s Channel 10, writing at Axios.com, notes:

The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway “in light of the Palestinians’ recent conduct.” The [three anonymous Western] diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA.

UNRWA differs from the main UN agency for all other refugees, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in that “UNRWA was designed only to support the Palestinian refugees within the refugee camps that the Arab states created,” Israeli diplomat Dore Gold writes in Tower of Babble: How the United Nations Fuels Global Chaos (2004). UNHCR “was supposed to find permanent homes for refugees and thus solve refugee crises.” Moreover, the UN created a separate definition of “refugee” for the Palestinians: to qualify, one need only have lived in Palestine for two years before the 1948 war.

And so UNRWA exists, essentially, to support Palestinians trapped in a propaganda ploy designed to weaken Israel. Breitbart Jerusalem editor Aaron Klein reported Friday that UNRWA refused to justify its population estimate of 500,000 refugees in camps in Lebanon after the official Lebanese census put the number at just a third of that total.

Over the years, UNRWA has been accused of supporting terrorism and teaching antisemitism to Palestinian children. In 2013, Breitbart News exposed a UNRWA summer program that was indoctrinating Palestinian children to hate Jews.

President Donald Trump and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley have hinted for several days that funding could be withheld from the Palestinians, due to Palestinian leaders’ criticism of the administration’s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, and their refusal to resume peace negotiations.

Meanwhile, North Korea’s Foreign Minister was spotted in Sweden, prompting speculation that he was doing advance work for Trump and Kim to meet there.

Trump spoke with Moon on Friday and said he still plans to meet with Kim by the end of May, according to Reuters.

Both the U.S. and South Korean presidents were described as cautiously optimistic that diplomacy could resolve the North Korean nuclear missile crisis. They also both stressed that North Korea needed to take concrete steps toward disarmament, and would not be allowed to use the spring summits as a delaying tactic while it forges ahead with weapons research.

President Moon’s chief of staff Im Jong-seok spoke of holding a meeting between North and South Korean officials in March that would help pave the way for Moon to meet with Kim Jong-un.

Im said the agenda for the North-South meeting would be “narrowed down” to “denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, securing permanent peace to ease military tension and new, bold ways to take inter-Korean relations forward.” Those are rather heavy topics. One can only wonder what the agenda for the meeting looked like before it was narrowed down.

Reuters notes that Trump’s telephone conversation with Moon also covered U.S.-South Korean trade issues, with Trump asking South Korea to “show flexibility” in negotiations and seeming to stand by his assessment of current trade agreements as “unfair” to the United States.

North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho arrived in Stockholm on Thursday for meetings with both Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven.

Lofven’s office refused to discuss the details of his meeting with Ri, but there is wide speculation in the media that Sweden could either host the Trump-Kim summit or assist with setting it up elsewhere. The Swedish embassy in Pyongyang has long facilitated diplomatic contact between North Korea and the United States, which does not have an embassy there.

“The whole world is naturally following the situation on the Korean peninsula. It is important, for security reasons it is of interest to us all. What is needed now is dialogue and we are happy to have this meeting. But we are not naïve and think that we can resolve all the problems of the world. It is up to the parties to decide how to go forward,” Wallstrom told reporters on Friday.

“If the main actors want Sweden to play a role – facilitate, be a forum or a link or whatever it may be—then we are ready to do that,” Prime Minister Lofven said in a separate interview.

“This is such an incredibly important issue. We are a country that is militarily non-aligned and have a longstanding presence in North Korea, and with the trust we enjoy we think we can play a role. But it has to be the main actors who decide which role Sweden will play,” he stressed.

The BBC describes the agenda for Ri’s surprise visit to Sweden as “broadening” to include “confidence-building measures with the U.S., including the release of U.S. citizens from North Korean detention.” The discussion is apparently going well enough for Ri to extend his stay for a few days.

The New York Times finds significance in the presence of Choe Kang-il, North Korea’s deputy director for North American affairs, as part of Ri’s mission to Sweden.

Also meaningful is South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha’s arrival in Washington on Thursday. Kang more-or-less openly said she was in D.C. to make sure the Trump-Kim meeting is still on track after the sudden dismissal of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson this week. Tillerson’s apparent replacement, former CIA Director Mike Pompeo, is seen as more skeptical of negotiations with North Korea than Tillerson was.New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman reports that President Donald Trump has privately asked Gen. John Kelly to help move his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner out of the White House.

According to the report:

Privately, some aides have expressed frustration that Mr. Kushner and his wife, the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, have remained at the White House, despite Mr. Trump at times saying they never should have come to the White House and should leave. Yet aides also noted that Mr. Trump has told the couple that they should keep serving in their roles, even as he has privately asked Mr. Kelly for his help in moving them out.

Publicly, Trump has defended the couple amidst growing press scrutiny about their activities at the White House.

“Jared’s done an outstanding job. I think he’s been treated very unfairly. He’s a high-quality person. He works for nothing, just so you know. Nobody ever reports that, but he gets zero,” Trump said during a press conference last week. “He doesn’t get a salary, nor does Ivanka.”This week’s “Saturday Night Live” cold open showed President Donald Trump receiving his intelligence from “Fox & Friends.”

The skit opened as a parody of “Fox & Friends” with Heidi Gardner as Ainsley Earhardt saying hello to President Trump, who she suggested was laying in the Lincoln Bedroom tweeting with an egg McMuffin on his chest.

Cecily Strong playing White House Communications Director Hope Hicks made an appearance and said that “Fox & Friends” blasts at “full volume” in all White House meetings.

Although the far-left New York Times is desperately hoping to control the explosion of this bombshell by shrouding it in a laughable story about the CIA trying to retrieve stolen National Security Agency cyber-weapons, the anti-Trump outlet is still forced to report that after “months of secret negotiations, a shadowy Russian bilked American spies out of $100,000 last year, promising to deliver stolen National Security Agency cyberweapons in a deal that he insisted would also include compromising material on President Trump, according to American and European intelligence officials.”

And that $100,000 was only supposed to be the first down payment towards a cool million.

The CIA was hoping for images of Trump urinating on hookers in Moscow hotel rooms. All they got was a 15-second clip of some guy in a hotel room talking to some women.

The payoff happened in September of last year.

Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA)

In early 2017, Democrat Adam Schiff, the ranking member of House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (so you would think he would know better), thought he was colluding with Ukrainian officials to get compromising materials against Trump. The Ukrainian officials ended up being Russian pranksters. The best you can say about Schiff is that he colluded with Russians to make a horse’s ass of himself.

Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)

In March of last year, Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence committee, colluded with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch to dig up dirt on Trump.

Naturally, because he has no spine, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) immediately ran to Warner’s defense. “Sen. Warner fully disclosed this to the committee four months ago,” the jellyfish tweeted. There is just one problem… If you look at the timeline, that “full disclosure” came a full seven months after the collusion occurred.

Rubio fired off another non-sequitur in Warner’s defense. “Has had zero impact on our work,” Rubio wrote, as though that means anything when it comes to the fact that Warner colluded with Russians to harm a sitting president and hid that information from the committee for more than a half-year.

Fusion GPS and Christopher Steele

Steele is the former British spy hired by the D.C.-based Fusion GPS to put together the phony Russian dossier that even disgraced former-FBI Director James Comey declared “salacious and unverified.”

To compile these lies, Steele reportedly worked directly with Kremlin officials:

How good were these sources? Consider what Steele would write in the memos he filed with Simpson: Source A—to use the careful nomenclature of his dossier—was “a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure.” Source B was “a former top level intelligence officer still active in the Kremlin.” And both of these insiders, after “speaking to a trusted compatriot,” would claim that the Kremlin had spent years getting its hooks into Donald Trump.

In other words, Steele and Fusion GPS colluded with the Russians to manufacture lies about Trump. Steele then leaked those lies to a complicit media in the hopes of manipulating the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

Fusion GPS also “spearheaded the campaign to undo the Magnitsky Act, American legislation imposing sanctions on Russian officials and other figures close to Vladimir Putin. Their work featured a smear campaign against the driving force behind the Magnitsky Act, financier William Browder.”

If successful, this Fusion GPS campaign would have been of great benefit to the Russian government and countless oligarchs who want the Magnitsky Act’s sanctions lifted.

The Hillary Clinton Campaign

Hillary’s 2016 presidential campaign hired Fusion GPS to put that dossier together. In other words, the Clinton campaign’s paid agents colluded with Kremlin officials to manufacture lies about Trump that would then be leaked to a complicit media in the hopes of manipulating the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

The Democrat National Committee (DNC)

The DNC hired the D.C.-based Fusion GPS to put that dossier together. In other words, the DNC’s paid agents colluded with Kremlin officials to manufacture lies about Trump that would then be leaked to a complicit media in the hopes of manipulating the outcome of the 2016 presidential election.

The FBI

Our own FBI not only put Steele on the payroll, a guy who colluded with the Russians to manufacture lies about Trump, the FBI used lies and the dossier — including Kremlin lies — to obtain FISA warrants to spy on Trump campaign affiliates.

For starters, director and co-writer Ryan Coogler does an A+ job of world building (more on this later). In addition, the soundtrack and score also deserve an A+. Then there are the actors, the best cast yet assembled in all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (by far).

Black Panther is set in the fictional Wakanda, an idyllic country hidden in the heart Africa thanks to an alien metal called vibranium. This resource (delivered eons ago by way of a meteor) not only gives Wakanda the ability to disguise itself as a third-world country (and therefore remain blissfully ignored by the outside world), but to enjoy an extraordinary standard of living through the miracles of technology and science.

The real Wakanda looks like an African country — open markets, vibrant colors, the architecture, the love of long-held traditions… But if you look closer, everyone enjoys the lifestyle of a Silicon Valley billionaire.

Wakanda is ruled by King T’Challa (Chadwick Boseman), who is also known as the Black Panther. T’Challa is big on border security, believes Wakanda and Wakandans should come first, and fiercely protects his country’s culture from outsiders, including refugees. If this is all starting to sound familiar, it should. Also like President Donald Trump, T’Challa’s beliefs are not based on race. This is not a “black thing.” This is a culture/survival thing.

Even the progressive Nakia (Lupita Nyong’o) — a more-than-capable spy and the woman T’Challa still carries a torch for (can you blame him?) — does not argue for open borders, liberal immigration policies, and a massive influx of refugees. She merely wants to export vibranium to help mankind.

The arrival of Erik “Killmonger” Stevens (an underused Michael B. Jordan) puts all of these arguments on hold. Killmonger (such a great name) is a man with mad killing skills and a burning grudge against Wakanda. T’Challa might be the Black Panther, but Killmonger is a Black Panther in the Huey Newton-Bobby Seale 1960 black nationalist sense. Like the Black Panther Party, Killmonger was born in Oakland, California, and to him everything is a “black thing.” He wants the vibranium exported in the form of weapons to overthrow white people.

Still, Black Panther is not a movie about race, it is a movie about ideas and ideals, about our shared humanity. Our hero is not in favor of protecting ethno-nationalism, but rather a healthy form of nationalism.

If T’Challa is Trump, Killmonger is Black Lives Matter.

Did I just write that?

Yes. I. Did.

Black Panther also has a wonderful sense of humor.

For politically incorrect reasons, and for decades, a big complaint of mine has been Hollywood’s marginalization of black actors. I cannot tell you how many times, in some supporting role, I have seen a charismatic black actor or actress — one who would blow off the screen these metrosexual pretty boys and shapeless forever-girls we’re being force fed — and said to my wife, “Why in the hell is this person not in every movie ever made?”

Multiculturalism is a cancer. Diversity is code for “hire more leftists!” I hate all that stuff. What I love are movies and movie stars — masculine men, womanly women — and Black Panther is buried in movie stars — real movie stars. The women are sexy, the men are men, the talent and charisma overwhelming.

More, please.

My only gripes, and they do matter, are the pacing and scope. You keep waiting for the story to take off, for the action to become spectacle, for the soar. Instead, the rollercoaster keeps climbing and climbing without ever reaching the top. The best action scene takes place in the first half hour, a car chase in Korea. After that, we are pretty much stuck on the plains of Africa with CGI’d actors fighting hand-to-hand.

We are also cheated. After we are made to fall in love with Wakanda, to share T’Challa’s desire to protect it, its people, its way of life, the investment fails to pay a dividend. Wakanda is never in any real danger, and this feels like a cheat.

Moreover, the action scenes are unimaginative, far from exciting or tense, like a computer-cartoon version of the battle scenes in Braveheart without the visceral moments. Except for the actors, Black Panther is lacking wows.

The actors, however, are worth the price of admission. And not just the film’s stars. The ageless Angela Bassett as the queen mother, the fierce and funny Danai Gurira as the king’s chief bodyguard, the endlessly charming Letitia Wright as T’Challa’s sister (and “Q”), Forest Whitaker, Winston Duke… Even the white guys are great. Andy Serkis kills as a South African gangster and Martin Freeman’s reaction-acting is still the best around.

Black Panther is filled smart politics, imagination, and movie star charisma — all that is missing is a satisfying payoff.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders presented the $100,000 check to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao at the daily press briefing on Tuesday.

Chao said that Donald Trump’s quarterly salary would go to the department’s INFRA (Infrastructure For Rebuilding America) Grant Programs.

“Infrastructure is the backbone of our economy, and it’s key to keeping our country competitive,” she said.

Chao and two transportation officials posed for a picture with the check.

Trump donated his quarterly salary to different institutions within the federal government, keeping his campaign promise to serve as president without a paycheck.

Previously he donated his paycheck to Department of Education, the National Park Service, and the Department of Health and Human Services combat to help fight the opioid epidemic.President Donald Trump urged Americans to move beyond the partisan attacks based on Russian attempts to meddle in the election.

“If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,” he wrote on Twitter. “They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!”

Trump fired off a series of messages on Twitter in response to Robert Mueller’s decision to indict 13 Russian online trolls for meddling in the election. In a pair of messages he “thanked” ‘Liddle’ Adam Schiff for pointing to President Barack Obama’s failure to stop the Russians.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Friday that there was no evidence that there was any American who was a “knowing participant” with the indicted Russians and that their efforts did not alter the outcome of the 2016 election.

Trump appears eager to move beyond Special Counsel Robert Muller’s investigation, although his efforts continue.President Donald Trump criticized Oprah Winfrey after she hosted a panel of voters during a special on 60 Minutes.

“Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes,” Trump wrote late Sunday night. “The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect.”

Winfrey’s panel was put together by pollster Frank Luntz to discuss Donald Trump — a mixture of liberals and conservatives in Michigan who weighed in on Trump’s first year.

Winfrey asked the panel about their response to the #MeToo movement, the president’s fitness for office, and the sexual harassment accusations against him during the campaign as well as his comments on Twitter about New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and his comment about “sh*thole countries.”

But Trump appeared ready to challenge Winfrey in the political arena.

“Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!” he wrote.

Here is a sample of questions Oprah asked about Trump:Eric Trump described the frustrations that he had with the media, despite all the success his father had as president.

“The media of this country does not understand the tone of this country,” he said. “They don’t understand that at all.”

Trump made his remarks during a CPAC conversation with Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk alongside students and activists in the conservative movement.

He described how it felt to spend his days on the campaign trail speaking to voters and then watching the news broadcasts at the end of the day.

Trump referred to an interview he had during the campaign with ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos who accused him of “living in a bubble,” when he said that the polls were wrong and his father would win.

“You’re sitting in a little sound studio on Broadway in New York and you’re reporting from here and you’re going to these parties with your little socialite friends, and I’m literally at every single victory office in the country,” he said.

Trump said he respected his father for continuing to fight the media and fight for the country.

“This country has been in such dire need of having a fighter,” he said. “We haven’t had a fighter in a long time. And so often he gets knocked for that, and I hate it.”

Trump urged students and activists at CPAC to fight for their beliefs despite the hatred and bullying from the left.

“We have to fight, we have to fight in so many ways, we’re going to be attacked, we’re all going to be attacked, believe me, there’s probably no people in the world that get attacked more than us,” he said.

Despite the hate, Trump said, more supporters needed to be publicly vocal about their beliefs to get the other side of their story to the rest of the country.

“Freedom of speech – there has to be debate – the second their stops being a debate in this country, everything shuts down,” he said.

Trump said that despite his father’s victory, the media continued to only tell one side of the story — one of opposition.

“We can’t have a silenced class,” he told the students. “It’s important that you go out there and you keep wearing the red, and you lead these student body organizations, and you keep fighting for what matters.”President Donald Trump energized conservative activists at CPAC on Friday, celebrating his accomplishments during his first year in office.

“Hey, we have got seven years to go, folks!” Trump told the audience who cheered wildly. The president arrived with a prepared speech but quickly abandoned the teleprompters in favor of a free-wheeling address.

Trump’s arrival thrilled the crowd who waited hours to get in for Trump’s speech. CPAC president Matt Schlapp said it was the biggest audience in history.

“I think now we’ve proved that I’m a conservative,” Trump said.

The speech quickly turned into a dynamic rally-style speech as Trump drew energy from the audience.

Catching sight of the video screen in the room, Trump joked about his hair.

“I try like hell to hide that bald spot, folks, I work hard at it,” he said. “It doesn’t look bad, hey we’re hanging in!”

Many of the supporters wearing red Trump campaign hats roared with delight when the president pulled out a copy of The Snake and read the poem.

But he got serious when he discussed the Florida school shooting, detailing his plan to allow trained teachers to use concealed guns in schools.

“A teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened,” he said, referring to the school.

The appearance lasted over an hour, as Trump spoke about his accomplishments in office — tax cuts, jobs, nominating conservative judges, and improving the economy.

Without mentioning Sen. John McCain by name, Trump pointed out that the Arizona senator was the single biggest reason that the Republican party failed to repeal Obamacare.

“One person walked into a room when he was supposed to go this way, and he said he was going this way, and he walked in, and he went this way, and everyone said, ‘What happened? What was that all about?’” Trump said.

He urged activists to re-energize for the midterms, warning that they were facing tough elections — and the historic nature of the party in power losing the congressional majority.

“Right now, we have a big race coming up in ’18. You have to get out. You have to just get that enthusiasm,” he said. “Keep it going.”

He promised to keep fighting for his supporters in the White House.

“I will let you know in the absolute strongest of terms, we’re going to make America great again, and I will never, ever, ever let you down,” he said.President Donald Trump will inspect the border-wall prototypes in mid-March, according to the Washington Post.

The timing may put the President at the California test site as Democrats consider whether to block the 2018 budget to halt $1.6 billion in wall-construction funds. The funds have appropriated by House and Senate committees, but have not approved by Senate. The 2018 funding plan is scheduled for congressional approval by March 23.

According to the Washington Post:

The president, who has rarely crossed the Mississippi River during his first 13 months in office, is scheduled to visit California in mid-March to see prototypes for a potential border wall and learn more about the construction, according to administration officials involved in the planning … Eight border wall prototypes are on display in a dusty lot near the border east of San Diego. The 30-foot-tall barriers use varying configurations of steel, concrete — even spikes — to create ramparts far more formidable than almost anything in place along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Tests conducted by the Department of Homeland Security have found the prototypes are nearly impossible to climb or break through … The Trump administration is seeking $18 billion for border wall construction over the next 10 years, an amount that would pay for roughly 300 miles of new barriers where none currently exist and allow the government to replace another 400 miles of older “legacy” fencing.

The trip would also include at least one fund-raiser in California and will likely encourage protests by far-left, anti-border groups.

Top Democrats oppose the improvement of the nation’s existing border wall. They also oppose the legal reforms that Trump says are needed to plug up the legal loopholes which allow hundreds of thousands of migrants to get into the United States to plead for asylum.On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher stated President Trump is “plainly a traitor, who doesn’t defend his own country.”

Maher said, “I just want to ask the Trump voters…what is left for you? He’s plainly a traitor, who doesn’t defend his own country. And, released his budget this week, remember, during the campaign, he said, ‘I would never cut Medicare, like the other[s], I would never cut?’ The budget cuts hundreds of billions of dollars. These Trump supporters, they’re not conservatives. They’re Drew Barrymore in ’50 First Dates.’ If you lose your memory every night, it all starts to make sense.”

Brzezinski commented on Ivanka Trump, who said questions about her father’s sexual misconduct allegations were inappropriate.

Brzezinski said, “It’s not like she is transportation secretary. She came in there to fight for women, and she can’t handle a question like that. The whole thing clearly is a joke, an utter joke just like Melania’s role on cyberbullying, which I think is an insult to women completely.”

She continued, “Furthermore insulting to women — these women have been given fake jobs.”

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENBoxing promoter and former boxer Oscar De La Hoya called out Donald Trump, inviting the president to attend the upcoming May 5 Canelo Alvarez – Gennady Golovkin bout at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas to show he cares about Mexicans.

De La Hoya said he “always has binoculars ready” for Trump to sit in the stands along with the Mexicans and fans from Kazakhstan.

“I dare him to come,” De La Hoya told TMZ Sports.

The retired boxer said “big fight fan” Trump would be a fan of the European Golovkin because he was not a “Mexican supporter.”

“I don’t think Trump is a Mexican supporter,” stated De La Hoya. “He’s more of a European supporter.”

He added, “Please come out, support the Mexicans. You know you love the Mexicans.”

Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrentMonday on Fox News Channel’s “Tucker Carlson Tonight,” host Tucker Carlson opened his show by scoffing at claims by CNN’s David Gergen and others that President Donald Trump was acting in an authoritarian manner.

Carlson argued it was instead the tendency of the left with its positions on speech, firearms, family, faith and bureaucracy that were signs of authoritarianism, not Trump.

Let's say you were an authoritarian & wanted to weaken American democracy. How'd you do it? 1) ban free speech 2) disarm the country 3) undermine families and churches 4) Empower unelected bureaucrats. Trump isn't doing that. The ruling class is #Tucker @FoxNews

Partial transcript as follows:

CARLSON: You may have noticed an accelerating cycle in Washington lately. Here’s what it looks like. The permanent class hates Donald Trump. They attack him as racist, criminal, a foreign spy working to destroy America.

Trump, because he watches more bad television than is healthy, sees these attacks and then responds with hostile tweets attacking his critics. His critics then point out those tweets as evidence that Trump is every bit as bad as they said he was and so on.

Well, the latest installment of the saga took place over the weekend. CNN political analyst David Gergen warned that Trump’s criticism of the media proves he’s a would-be dictator. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

DAVID GERGEN, “CNN” POLITICAL ANALYST: Discrediting Mueller, discrediting what may come out through the Justice Department from Mueller, discrediting the press and what we’re reporting on what Mueller does, this is what splits a country apart and it is the beginnings – in many other countries, it’s been the beginnings of an authoritarian rule. And that’s the larger threat hanging over us now.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

CARLSON: That’s kind of hilarious. The irony, of course, is that David Gergen spent much of his own career in government, not simply criticizing reporters, but actively lying to them, as is the custom. Was that the behavior of a despot? Pretty funny.

But pause and consider this seriously for a minute. Authoritarianism. That’s what our ruling class says it fears. They tell us that all the time.

OK. Let’s say you really were an authoritarian and you wanted to weaken American democracy and impose a kind of oligarchy on the country. How would you go about doing that?

Well, you’d probably start by trying to control what people say and think. If citizens dissented from the mandated orthodoxy or dared to consider unauthorized ideas, you target them, you’d shame them on social media, you’d shout them down in public, you’d get them fired from their jobs, you’d make sure everybody was afraid to disagree with you.

After that, you would work to disarm the population. You take their guns away. That way, they’d be entirely dependent on you for their safety, not to mention unable to resist your plans for them.

Then, just to make sure you had quelled all opposition, you’d systematically target any institution that might oppose or put brakes on your power. You’d be especially concerned about churches, the family, and independent businesses. You’d be certain to undermine and crush those using laws and relentless propaganda.

If despite all of that, election results still didn’t go your way, you’d use an entrenched unelected bureaucracy to neuter any leader you hadn’t handpicked yourself. But you’d be shaken by an election like that. You’d resolve never to allow one again.

And to make sure of that, you’d work tirelessly to replace the old and ungrateful population with a new and more obedient one. That’s what you do.

Sound familiar? We are not talking about Donald Trump. For all of his faults, Trump isn’t doing any of that. Our ruling class is. And that’s what all these issues are really about.

The speech codes, the calls for gun control, the relentless attacks on the nuclear family, the demands for unlimited mass immigration, none of that is designed to help you. None of it will make you happier or more prosperous. That’s not the point.

The point is to make you more dependent on the very people who are yelling at you right now on cable television. They are the authoritarians.The Los Angeles Times points out an odd bit of presidential trivia as 2017 comes to a close: President Donald Trump could become the first president since Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower not to visit the State of California in his first full year in office.

The Times reports:

Trump is about to become the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower 64 years ago to skip a visit to California during his first calendar year in office. And he doesn’t appear to have any plans to take Air Force One to the country’s most populous and economically powerful state before he marks his first full year in office Jan. 20. Even past presidents who, like Trump, didn’t win the state’s electoral votes made it a destination, if only for California’s allure as the Golden State of campaign cash.

The Times notes that California might be a problematic destination for Trump in particular because the state has declared itself to be “ground zero” for the so-called “Resistance” to his presidency. State politicians have sued the administration over almost all of its major policies, and thousands of activists have organized regular protests against Trump in the Golden State, even taking over Hollywood’s vaunted Gay Pride festival for the purpose.

Trump has also accused California of allowing voter fraud, which he alleged earlier this year had cost him a popular vote victory over Hillary Clinton because of the large margin she ran up in the state. (Without California, Trump would have won the popular vote nationwide as well as the Electoral College vote.)

The president did provide rapid disaster aid for California to aid with flooding as well as wildfires in 2017.

There are still three weeks left before the first anniversary of Trump taking office, but he seems to have no plans to visit before then.

According to the White House, the president will host a listening session with high school students and teachers on Wednesday and a meeting with state and local officials on Thursday to discuss school safety.

Trump also signaled interest in moving forward legislation on improving background checks in response to the school shooting in Florida. The legislation is also supported by the National Rifle Association.

In his remarks after the shooting, Trump said his “top priority” would be “making our schools and our children safer.”

“It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference,” he said. “We must actually make that difference.”President Donald Trump appeared eager to make a deal on DACA, urging Republicans and Democrats to come together.

“Negotiations on DACA have begun. Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle.”

In a concession to Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to begin a debate on the issue this week.

One Senate aide described to Axios the debate as a chance for senators to “put your big boy and big girl pants on, and put your ideas on the floor for a vote.”

Trump cited the March 5th deadline as an ultimatum for Democrats to make a deal.

“This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity!” he wrote. “March 5th.”

On Monday, Trump urged Democrats to concede on funding border security and closing legal loopholes important to the president.

“If the Democrats want to make a deal, it’s really up to them, because we want really tremendous border security, but we have to have Democrat support for DACA, and they are starting that process today,” he said during a meeting at the White House.President Donald Trump said at the 66th annual National Prayer Breakfast in Washington, DC, on Thursday that millions of people are suffering under repressive governments, and he called out Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, and North Korea by name.

“We know that millions of people in Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, and other countries suffer under repressive and brutal regimes,” Trump said. “America stands with all people suffering oppression and religious persecution.”

Trump also spoke about religious beliefs being “central” to Americans and their way of life.

“Faith is central to American life and liberty,” Trump said.

The president also said that America’s connection to God is not only “etched into the hearts of Americans,” but is visible all around, from the “Praise Be to God” on the Washington Monument to “In God We Trust” on American currency.

“How blessed we truly are to be Americans,” Trump stated.

Trump recognized Sophia Marie Campa-Peters, a nine-year-old girl for whom White House press secretary Sara Sanders asked Americans to pray last month when she was undergoing brain surgery for a medical condition that causes strokes.

Campa-Peters and her mother were at the breakfast, and Campa-Peters stood and waved to the crowd.

Trump said doctors told her she might not walk again but that Campa-Peters defied the odds.

“This little girl has God on her side,” Trump said.

Trump also praised House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA), who survived being shot by a gunman last summer during a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia.

“Your presence reminds us … that with God, all things are possible,” Trump said.President Donald Trump announced on Twitter Saturday that he felt vindicated by the memo declassified by the House Intelligence Committee.

“This memo totally vindicates ‘Trump’ in probe,” the president wrote on Twitter. “But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on.”

Trump sent his message to Twitter five minutes before he arrived by motorcade to his golf club in Palm Beach, Florida.

He again denied any collusion with Russia during the election as well as trying to obstruct justice. Reports about Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation have focused on possible obstruction of justice in response to reports about a campaign meeting with a Russian source who purported to have damaging information about Hillary Clinton.

“Their (sic) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead),” Trump continued on Twitter. “This is an American disgrace!”President Donald Trump said on Monday that the U.S. government will impose a “reciprocal tax” on imports from countries that levy tariffs against American made goods.

“We’re going to charge countries outside of our country–countries that take advantage of the United States, some of them are so-called allies but they’re not allies on trade,” Trump said during a White House meeting on infrastructure. “We’re going to be doing very much a reciprocal tax and you’ll be hearing about that during the week and coming months.”

Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross applauded the idea, saying that the U.S. needs to “claw back” the revenue other countries raise by taxing U.S. products.

The U.S. has very low tariffs compared with some of our biggest trading partners. The trade-weighted average of U.S. tariffs is just 2.4 percent. China’s is 4.4 percent.

While Congress has the authority to set taxes and tariffs, the law authorizes the president to unilaterally impose tariffs in certain circumstances. In January, for example, the administration announced that it would impose tariffs on washing machines and solar products. The administration could potentially expand its use of these types of sanctions instead of waiting on Congress to pass new tariffs.

Last week, government data revealed that the U.S. trade deficit widened in December to its highest level since 2008, highlighting the urgent need for an “American First” trade policy.President Trump opened the door Thursday morning to a national gun registry via his proposed “comprehensive background checks.”

He called for such checks via Twitter:

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue – I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Although there is a lack of clarity on what Trump means by “comprehensive background checks,” as to whether he is referencing an overhaul of our current system or is pushing the universal background checks lauded by Democrats, it is important to note that this represents a turning point which opens the door to a national gun registry.

This is so because universal background checks are not enforceable without a gun registry.

For contemporary, real world proof of this danger just look at California, where universal background checks led to registration requirements which resulted in gun confiscation laws. This has all played out before our eyes and is evident to those who pay attention.

For evidence from law enforcement, just consider the way New Mexico Sheriff’s rallied to defeat universal background checks on the grounds that such checks would have led to a gun registry in that state. On February 9, 2017, Breitbart News reported that 32 of New Mexico’s 33 sheriffs signed a letter opposing the universal background checks that were being debated in the state legislature at that time. They described the checks as a “scheme” that “would be unenforceable without creating a gun registry.”

In addition to the contemporary evidence from California and the evidence from law enforcement, common sense proves that a gun registry is necessary if the government is to know who is selling a gun, when they are selling it, and to whom they are selling it. In other words, government officials cannot know that gun sales are being universally monitored unless they know the name of every gun owner and have identifying information about every gun possessed by those owners.

Would a gun registry prevent mass shootings? No, but it would set the stage for the kind of confiscatory actions seen in California. And it would be another step toward narrowing the means to acquire firearms, thereby empowering the government to more easily restrict the guns law-abiding citizens can or cannot own, as we have seen in California.

On August 8, 2016, Hillary Clinton used a Newsweek column to call for “comprehensive background checks.” On February 22, 2018, Trump tweeted his support for “comprehensive background checks” as well. The question before us is whether Trump is voicing support for the same checks Clinton had in mind. If so, a gun registry will be necessary to make them work.

President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December, which repealed Obamacare’s individual mandate.

Trump then chided Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), arguing that McCain blocked Obamacare repeal.

“I don’t want to be controversial, so I won’t use his name,” Trump remarked, adding that one senator [McCain] voted with his thumbs down instead of voting with his thumbs up.

Sen. McCain voted against the “skinny” repeal bill of Obamacare and then blocked the Graham-Cassidy block grant repeal bill last year.

President Trump then suggested that repealing Obamacare “piece by piece by piece” may serve as a better strategy than trying to repeal Obamacare with a comprehensive replacement bill such as Graham-Cassidy or the House-passed American Health Care Act (AHCA).

House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that he, along with other House Republicans, continue to work on legislation that would prevent the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) from collecting Obamacare employer mandate fines as well as legislation that would lower health insurance premiums.

Meadows revealed, “There are a number of us that believe that in the next 90 days, we must require action to bring premiums down. I think you will see a flurry of legislative ideas that will try to do exactly that.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in October to expand short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. Before the executive order, Americans could only purchase these short-term health insurance plans for a maximum of three months; thanks to President Trump’s executive order, Americans can now retain the short-term health plan for any period under 12 months.

Trump remarked that these short-term health insurance plans “cost a fraction of the price” of an Obamacare plan.

Short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with all of the Obamacare insurance regulations such as community rating and essential health benefits, allowing Americans to have more affordable health insurance options.

In October, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised Trump’s executive order as “the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation,” adding that it will allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma claimed in a statement on Tuesday, “Americans who find themselves between jobs or simply can’t afford coverage because prices are too high will be helped by President Trump’s Healthcare for All Executive Order.”WASHINGTON, DC – President Donald Trump and Congress are taking official action to honor the passing of Rev. Billy Graham last Wednesday, through a presidential proclamation and the announcement that Graham’s body will lie in honor in the U.S. Capitol—only the fourth private citizen in American history to receive such honors.

After Graham passed on February 21 at the age of 99, President Trump issued a presidential proclamation that begins:

As a mark of respect for the memory of Reverend Billy Graham, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that on the day of his internment, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff.

This proclamation covers not only the White House, but also all public buildings nationwide, all U.S. military installations, and at all U.S. embassies around the world.

On Friday, President Trump eulogized Graham at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on the border of D.C. “We will never forget the historic crowds, that voice, the energy, and the profound faith of a preacher named Billy Graham,” the president declared.

“As a young man, Billy decided to devote his life to God,” President Trump continued. “That choice not only changed his life, it changed our country. And indeed, it even changed the world.”

Congress is likewise demonstrating its collective admiration of Graham by deciding that his body should lie in honor in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol this Wednesday.

While Congress has allowed former U.S. presidents or leading members of Congress to lie in state, only three private citizens have ever been privileged to lie in honor in the Capitol. Two were U.S. Capitol police officers who died in the line of duty protecting congressmen and civilians inside the Capitol in 1998. The other one was the iconic civil-rights pioneer Rosa Parks in 2005.

Graham spent his entire adult life as an Evangelical Christian preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ: the simple message that God so loved the world that he sent his son Jesus to die on the cross in the place of sinners, so that anyone who repented of their sin and placed their faith in Jesus would be forgiven by God and restored to a relationship with him.

The Hill reports that Trump mentioned that the “process” of banning bump stocks began in December.

It was December 28, 2017, when Breitbart News reported that the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) was accepting public comment on proposed regulatory gun control that would alter the definition of “machinegun” to cover machineguns and non-machineguns, too. This shift allows the ATF to use the National Firearms Act (1934) to control firearm accessories like bump stocks in the same way it controls actual machine guns and devices that convert semiautomatic firearms into machine guns.

Gun control outlet The Trace reported that the public comment period ended with roughly 36,000 comments, of which more than eight out of ten voiced opposition to bump stock gun control.

Yet Trump is supporting regulatory action against the firearm accessories.

CNN’s Kaitlan Collins tweeted:

President Trump announces he has directed Attorney General Jeff Sessions to propose regulations that would ban all devices that turn legal weapons into machine guns. — Kaitlan Collins (@kaitlancollins) February 20, 2018

Trump also said he expects regulations banning bump stocks to “be finalized … very soon.”

Bump stocks were not used in the February 14 attack in Florida. Nor were they used in the Texas church attack (November 5, 2017), the Alexandria attack (June 14, 2017), the Orlando attack (June 12, 2016), the San Bernardino attack (December 2, 2015), the Umpqua Community College attack (October 1, 2015), the Lafayette movie theater attack (July 23, 2015), the Chattanooga attack (July 16, 2015), the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attack (Jun 17, 2015), the Santa Barbara attack (May 23, 2014), the Fort Hood attack (April 2, 2014), the D.C. Navy Yard attack (September 16, 2013), the Aurora movie theater attack (July 20, 2012), the Gabby Giffords (January 8, 2011) attack, or the Virginia Tech attack (April 16, 2007), among others.

In fact, the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack is the only high profile public attack in which a bump stock was used criminally.

Sign up to get Down Range at breitbart.com/downrange.While Americans are celebrating bigger paychecks thanks to historic tax reform and corporations are announcing huge new investments and job creation, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) are advancing their plan to impeach President Donald Trump.

CBC member Rep. Al Green’s (D-TX) articles of impeachment are based on what he and others in the caucus say are the remarks Trump has made on everything from Barack Obama’s birthplace to football players.

“The articles of impeachment put forth by Green don’t allege Trump has committed a crime; instead, they assert that Trump has “brought the high office of president of the United States in contempt, ridicule, disgrace, and disrepute” and “has sown discord among the people of the United States,” the Hill reported.

The articles of impeachment cite Trump’s alleged remarks about “shithole countries,” his comments about the NFL “take a knee” protests during the National Anthem, and his opinion on protesters and counter-protesters over the removal of a Confederate monument in Charlottesville, Virginia last summer.

“Green argued that Trump is “legitimizing bigotry” by “aggravating such controversies,” the Hill reported

Just under two-thirds of the 48-member CBC has backed impeachment, including Rep. James Clyburn (S.C.), the third-ranking House Democrat, who protested with other anti-Trump lawmakers at the State of the Union event on Tuesday by wearing African shawls, the Hill reported.

“We thought that it was necessary for us to demonstrate, as members of the Congress, our displeasure with the president,” Clyburn said.

Others in the CBC who back impeachment include Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC), Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and Rep. Frederica Wilson (D-FL).

“Nearly all of the (66) Democrats on the record in support of impeachment represent deep-blue districts where their constituents want their lawmakers to show resistance to Trump,” the Hill reported.

Green’s efforts to impeach the president have been ongoing. In November he took to the House floor to promise an impeachment vote before Christmas.

“I now announce that before Christmas, there will be a vote on the ‘Chief Inciter’ of racism, bigotry, hatred, xenophobia, sexism, ethnocentrism,” Congressman Al Green said on the House floor. “There will be a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, on the impeachment of the president.”

Green devotes an entire page on his official Congressional website featuring his speeches, news articles, and videos dating back to January 2017 to this campaign against President TrumpPresident Trump made clear Wednesday that he is moving forward with certain gun controls despite NRA opposition.

CNN quoted Trump saying, “Half of you are so afraid of the NRA. And you know what? There’s nothing to be afraid of.”

A senior administration official confirmed that the big sticking point between Trump and the NRA is Trump’s plan to raise the minimum age for rifle purchases from 18-years old 21-years old. But the White House did caveat that intention by suggesting the increased age may only be on “certain firearms.”

Either way, the NRA opposes it, and NRA leadership made this clear during meetings with Trump over the weekend.

But Trump remains determined. In addition to raising the minimum age for long gun purchases Trump is also rallying behind new gun laws for our background check system. These new laws were put forth by Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) and John Cornyn (R-TX), in legislation called “Fix NICS.” The legislation was introduced after the Air Force failed to report the Texas church shooter’s criminal conviction to the background check system, thus allowing him to legally acquire a gun.

Ironically, while Trump’s support Cornyn’s action on background checks, Cornyn is not excited about Trump’s effort to raise the minimum age for long gun purchases. Cornyn doubts whether raising the minimum age for long gun purchases would save lives.

Those moments are “MAGA moments,” when it was clear that Trump was keeping his promise to Make America Great Again.

Here are some of the biggest MAGA moments of the year:

12) The inauguration speech

Prior to the inauguration on January 20, 2017, establishment politicians and media figures urged Trump to unite the country and reach out to both sides of the aisle. But Trump delivered a swamp-draining populist speech in front of the Washington, DC, elite:

The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you.

11) Getting tough with Cuba

In June, Donald Trump rolled back many of the agreements that former President Barack Obama made with the Castro regime in Cuba, vowing to stand for freedom in the region.

“The previous administration’s easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people; they only enrich the Cuban regime,” Trump said in a speech at the Manuel Artime Theater in Miami, Florida.

Now that I am your president, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere, whether in Cuba or Venezuela, and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams.

10) American hostages freed

In October, Trump announced the release of Caitlan Coleman, Joshua Boyle, and their three children, who were held captive in Afghanistan. After their release was secured, Trump thanked Pakistan for working with his administration to secure their release:

“I believe they’re starting to respect the United States again. It’s very important,” Trump said. “I think right now, a lot of countries are starting to respect the United States of America once again.”

Trump also secured the release of American charity worker Aya Hijazi from Egypt in April, Sandy Phan-Gillis in May, and the release of Otto Warmbier in June.

9) Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel’s capital city

In December, Donald Trump again defied the common thinking of the foreign policy establishment elite, recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.

“While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver,” he said at the White House. “Today, I am delivering”:

I fulfilled my campaign promise – others didn’t! pic.twitter.com/bYdaOHmPVJ — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2017

8: The joint address to Congress and tribute to Special Forces soldier Ryan Owens

In February, Trump delivered an address to Congress, urging members of both parties to come together to restore America’s greatness.

During his speech, the president recognized the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator Senior Chief William “Ryan” Owens, who was killed in a recent military operation:

Trump said, “For as the Bible teaches us, ‘There is no greater act of love than to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’ Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom. And we will never forget Ryan.”

It was a powerful moment in the House chamber, kicking off Trump’s presidency.

7) Drive them out!

On his first international trip as president, Trump traveled to Saudi Arabia to outline his tough vision for combating radical Islamic terrorism:

At one point, Trump was emphatic:

A better future is only possible if your nations drive out the terrorists and extremists. Drive. Them. Out. DRIVE THEM OUT of your places of worship. DRIVE THEM OUT of your communities. DRIVE THEM OUT of your holy land, and DRIVE THEM OUT OF THIS EARTH.

6) Trump defends Western values in Europe

During a trip to Poland, President Trump delivered a strong speech about the importance of defending Western civilization:

He stated:

As the Polish experience reminds us, the defense of the West ultimately rests not only on means, but also on the will of its people to prevail and be successful and get what you have to have. The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive. Do we have the confidence in our values to defend them at any cost? Do we have enough respect for our citizens to protect our borders? Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it? We can have the largest economies and the most lethal weapons anywhere on earth, but if we do not have strong families and strong values, then we will be weak, and we will not survive.

5) Ending the Paris climate change deal

In June, Trump announced his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, fulfilling another campaign promise.

“I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris,” he said during his announcement:

As president, I have one obligation, and that obligation is to the American people. The Paris Accord would undermine our economy, hamstring our workers, weaken our sovereignty, impose unacceptable legal risks, and put us at a permanent disadvantage to the other countries of the world. It is time to exit the Paris Accord — (applause) — and time to pursue a new deal that protects the environment, our companies, our citizens, and our country.

4) Rescinding DACA

In September, Trump rescinded former President Barack Obama’s overreach of executive power to give amnesty to illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children. Although Trump expressed interest in providing amnesty for the so-called DREAMers, he insisted that it would have to go through Congress.

“There can be no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is able to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will,” he said in a statement.

3) Withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)

In January, Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, fulfilling one of his promises on trade.

“We just officially terminated TPP,” Trump said during a meeting with workers and union leaders, who applauded at the news:

2) Nominating Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court

In April, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise to nominate a strict constitutionalist Supreme Court justice to the Supreme Court to replace Justice Antonin Scalia.

Trump said, “[Scalia’s] image and genius was in my mind throughout the decision-making process,” and he selected Justice Neil Gorsuch to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court:

Trump added:

Millions of voters said this was the single-most important issue to them when they voted for me for president. I am a man of my word. I will do as I say, something that the American people have been asking for from Washington for a very, very long time.

1) Signing the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act



Trump closed out the year by signing his biggest legislation to date. The bill signed by the president dramatically reformed the tax code, eliminated the individual mandate for Obamacare, and opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to drilling. It was the first big win for Trump’s presidency, as he worked together with Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

“Paul Ryan and Mitch — it was a little team,” Trump said. “We just got together, and we would work very hard. … It was a lot of fun. It’s always a lot of fun when you win. If you work hard and lose, that’s not acceptable.”President @realDonaldTrump on Dem FISA memo: "A lot of bad things happened on the other side, not on this side, but the other side. And somebody should look into it because what they did was really fraudulent." pic.twitter.com/PgEyKLAYEM

Saturday, President Donald Trump phoned into Fox News Channel’s “Justice” and he discussed the Democratic FISA memo, calling it a “confirmation” of the Devin Nunes memo.

“Certainly the memo was a nothing,” Trump said to host Jeanine Pirro. “That was really just a confirmation of — if you call it the Republican memo or the Nunes memo, it’s referred to as a lot of things, but that was nothing but a confirmation.”

“A lot of bad things happened on the other side, not on this side, but the other side. And somebody should look into it because what they did was really fraudulent,” he continued.

Trump tweeted Saturday that the memo was a “BUST.”

Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrentPresident Donald Trump told Piers Morgan that he did not consider himself a feminist, resisting a growing trend by modern men to describe themselves that way.

“No, I wouldn’t say I’m a feminist. I mean, I think that would be, maybe, going too far. I’m for women, I’m for men, I’m for everyone,” Trump said in the interview, according to Morgan.

According to a 2015 Vox poll only 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, even though a wide majority support equal rights for women.

The former CNN host shared the news nugget on Twitter, teasing to his full interview that will air in the United Kingdom on Sunday.

Trump interviewed with Morgan during his trip to Davos, Switzerland.Monday while filling in as a co-host on ABC’s “The View,” CNN political commentator Ana Navarro criticized President Donald Trump’s eating habits while referencing a report that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani made a fat joke about Hillary Clinton at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser over the weekend.

Navarro first slammed the Oscars for not hitting Trump more, saying, “I actually was watching for more Trump jokes, more NRA messages, more of that stuff. I can’t stand Trump. I was actually disappointed.”

Navarro then went after Trump’s weight saying, “This weekend it was reported, at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser for Trump donors, Giuliani made a fat joke against Hillary. Mind you, he’s raising funds for Trump, who hasn’t eaten something green that’s not an M&M in 60 years.”

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENThe Bishop of Liverpool has attacked Christians who support President Donald J. Trump and “a system which builds walls instead of bridges”.

Paul Bayes, a senior figure in the Church of England, also appeared to argue that backing “rightwing populism” could be incompatible with biblical teaching.

His intervention comes just days after the Archbishop of Canterbury, who leads the church, used his Christmas address to target so-called “tyrannical and populist” world leaders – widely perceived as a dig at Mr. Trump.

Adding to the politicised onslaught, Mr. Bayes told the British left-wing Guardian newspaper: “Some of the things that have been said by religious leaders seem to collude with a system that marginalises the poor, a system which builds walls instead of bridges, a system which says people on the margins of society should be excluded, a system which says we’re not welcoming people any more into our country.”

He said he regretted that “people who call themselves evangelical in the US seem to be uncritically accepting” positions taken by Trump and his allies.

“Some quite significant so-called evangelical leaders are uncritically supporting people in ways that imply they are colluding or playing down the seriousness of things which in other parts of their lives [they] would see as really important,” Bayes added.

Mr. Bayes, who has been bishop of Liverpool since 2014, added: “If people want to support rightwing populism anywhere in the world, they are free to do so. The question is, how are they going to relate that to their Christian faith?

“And if what I believe are the clear teachings of the gospel about love for all, the desire for justice and for making sure marginalised and defenceless people are protected, if it looks as though those teachings are being contradicted, then I think there is a need to say so.”Anti-sharia legislation is spreading in state legislatures across the US, as Donald Trump’s hostile stance towards Muslims appears to be emboldening rightwing Islamaphobes.

In 2017 there were 23 new bills introduced in 18 states attempting to prohibit the practice of Islamic religious law, or sharia, in US courts. The rash of new bills brings the total number of such legislative efforts since 2010 to 217 in 43 states, according to the Haas Institute at UC Berkeley which monitors the anti-sharia movement.

Most of the recent bills are careful not to refer overtly to sharia or Islam, as to do so would be to expose the legislation to the scrutiny of federal courts on grounds of religious discrimination.

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENA growing force of free trade globalists are working inside and outside the White House to stop President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs, while White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is trying to promote them.

“It’s Peter Navarro, Wilbur Ross, and President Trump against the world,” a source with close ties to the White House told Breitbart News.

Cohn lost the battle against Navarro after Trump announced the tariffs in spite of his advice. But Cohn is determined not to lose the war, working to appeal to the president’s deal-making nature to reduce the impact of the tariffs.

On Monday night, news leaked to Politico of Cohn’s effort to get corporate opponents of the president’s proposed tariffs a meeting with the president, frustrated that Trump was not listening to his advice.

House Speaker Paul Ryan signaled concern about the tariffs in phone calls with the president but said the substance of the conversations will remain private.

“We’ve had multiple conversations about this, he knows our view. Every now and then we’re just going to have a different approach as to how we tackle these problems, but it should be acknowledged there is a problem that needs to be addressed here,” Ryan said in a press conference on Tuesday.

Ryan called for action “more surgical and more targeted,” than universal tariffs, pointing to the problem of countries like China “dumping” subsidized steel and aluminum on the American market.

Another Washington opponent of the tariffs is former Bush budget director Josh Bolten — now a high-powered and well-paid lobbyist as CEO of Business Roundtable.

Bolten has mobilized top CEOs who supported Trump’s tax cuts against his proposed trade measures.

“Business Roundtable CEOs are making the case directly to President Trump and his trade and economic policy advisors,” a spokeswoman told FOX Business.

Trump allies are astounded at how brazenly Cohn is working to undermine the president’s trade agenda since it was a big reason why he won the election.

As the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, Cohn is well-sourced with high-powered business allies and knows how to wage war behind the scenes, using the media and the business community. Navarro and Ross have tried to counter critics by dismissing the hysterics on cable news.

Outside Trump allies believe White House aides who were upset by the tariff announcement last week leaked suggestions that it was the result of an unstable president frustrated with media coverage of his son-in-law Jared Kushner.

Cohn appears comfortable in the administration, despite rumors that he plans to leave after the successful push for tax cuts. Trump, however, has told advisers that Cohn will leave if the tariffs are enacted, according to Bloomberg News.

A White House spokesperson declined a request for comment from Breitbart News.

Trump supporters like economist Larry Kudlow are urging Cohn to stay and fight.

“I have to tell you, personally, I am urging Gary Cohn to stay and fight for another day. He’s done a great job,” Kudlow told CNBC. Kudlow opposes the president’s positions on tariffs, but admits that Trump is determined to make changes on trade.

Global leaders have also called to express their concerns about Trump’s proposed tariffs. A Downing Street spokesperson noted that Prime Minister Theresa May “raised our deep concern” about the proposed tariffs on Sunday. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with Trump to discuss his concerns about trade.

Despite the forces mobilizing against Trump, he remains resolute to move forward on tariffs.

“We’re not backing down,” Trump told reporters on Monday.Daniel Frisiello was arrested on Thursday for sending a white powder-filled letter to Donald Trump Jr.’s Manhattan apartment last month that sent his wife, Vanessa, and two other people to the hospital for observation.

Frisiello’s Facebook page says he’s a program assistant at Catholic Charities Archdiocese of Boston and is filled with anti-President Donald Trump posts. His record also shows connections to the Democratic Party.

Police tracked him down after he sent another powder-laced letter to a university professor.

Fox News reported:

The Massachusetts man who allegedly mailed a white powder to Donald Trump Jr. has previously donated to a Democratic political action committee and shared anti-Trump posts on social media, including comparing President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Daniel Frisiello, 24, was arrested Thursday after authorities tracked him down following the examination of a “glitter bomb” letter sent to Stanford University law professor Michele Dauber. Investigators matched the text font from the letter to other threats sent to those seen on the letters of the white-powder envelopes. Authorities said the letter included a threatening note that read: “You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV. You the family idiot. Eric looks smart.” The letter was postmarked in Boston on Feb. 7, had an American flag stamp and no return address. The powder was ultimately determined to be corn starch, the Associated Press reported.

Frisiello allegedly sent five letters filled with white powder and is charged with “threat to injure the person of another and false information and hoaxes,” according to Fox News.

“In April 2016, he contributed $75 to ActBlue, a political action committee that works to raise money online for Democratic candidates and committees, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC),” Fox News reported.

Frisiello also posted an article detailing one of his crimes on Facebook, which is now filled with comments denouncing him.

“Person going to prison for sending threats and powder…. liberal fart ass,” another person wrote.President Donald Trump took time off from his Christmas vacation to mock Vanity Fair magazine after the publication apologized for a video mocking Hillary Clinton.

“Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Trump was referring to a video published by Vanity Fair that urged Clinton to “take up a new hobby in the New Year” to keep her from running for office, including volunteer work, knitting, or improv comedy.

Vanity Fair apologized for the video after it caused backlash on social media.

“It was an attempt at humor and we regret that it missed the mark,” the publication said.

Trump also mocked Condé Nast creative director Anna Winter for “begging for forgiveness” from Clinton. Condé Nast owns Vanity Fair and Vogue.

Wintour, according to Trump, was “all set” to become the ambassador to the United Kingdom after her overwhelming financial support for Hillary Clinton. Wintour is also the editor of Vogue, which featured glowing profile spreads of Clinton.

Trump said that Wintour was “beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness” in response to the Clinton video.

The president sent his message on Twitter while he was at his golf course in Palm Beach, Florida.

Trump has a long history of ripping on Vanity Fair since 2012, correctly predicting that its editor would be replaced.

“That dope Graydon Carter has hit on me for 25 years,” Trump wrote about the editor in 2012. “His magazines always fail.”

@OXSapphireXO @VanityFair No, that dope Graydon Carter has hit on me for 25 years. His magazines always fail (see SPY) — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2012

Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine. Way down, big trouble, dead! Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 15, 2016

I have watched sloppy Graydon Carter fail and close Spy Magazine and now am watching him fail at @VanityFair Magazine. He is a total loser! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 15, 2015

I wonder what the work atmosphere is like @VanityFair. It must be hard working at a dying institution. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2012

After the presidential election, Vanity Fair ripped the Trump Grill in Trump Tower, suggesting that it could be the “worst restaurant in America”

In November, the Trumps criticized the magazine for publishing a story citing a “longtime friend of the Trumps” who claimed that Melania Trump never wanted to be the first lady and did not think he would win the presidency.

“Once again part of the liberal media, this time Vanity Fair, has written a story riddled with unnamed sources and false assertions,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “As a magazine tailored to women it is shameful that they continue to write salacious and false stories mean to demean Mrs. Trump, rather than focus on her positive work as First Lady and a supportive wife and mother. As has been stated on the record many times before, she is honored by her role.”Donald Trump had several ups and downs in the first year of his presidency, but he always appeared to enjoy his new job as president of the United States. Here are some of the best photos from 2017.

2) Staring at the sun

During a White House event to highlight the solar eclipse that was passing across the United States, Trump pointed to the sun and looked up without his eclipse glasses on. It was something that scientists spent weeks warning Americans not to do, but Trump does whatever he wants!

1) The orb

During his first trip overseas, President Donald Trump visited Riyadh, Saudi Arabia where they opened a new Global Center for Combatting Extremist Ideology. The three leaders touched a glowing orb, which kicked off a video introduction to the center.Shortly after being elected president, Donald Trump signed an executive order directing all federal agencies to find two regulations to cut for every new one issued. Agencies also were asked to pay for new regulatory costs by eliminating existing rules.

In December, Trump said the goals set out in that executive order had not only been met but exceeded.

“We blew our target out of the water,” Trump said, noting that his administration had eliminated 22 regulations for every new one put in place.

The Associated Press reported on Trump’s remarks at the White House as he stood next to giant stacks of paper representing the regulatory slashing his administration has done over the past year.

“For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regulations, rules, restrictions has cost our country trillions and trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, and devastated many industries,” Trump said.

AP reported:

Neomi Rao, the administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said the administration had completed 67 deregulatory actions and taken three regulatory actions through the end of September that would result in a cost savings of $570 million a year. Those deregulatory actions include a wide range of actions, including the withdrawal of guidance documents and reductions in paperwork burdens, and a dozen regulations killed by Congress, Rao said. More than 1,500 regulations other rules and regulations have been withdrawn, delayed, or are under reconsideration, officials said.

AP said that Trump expressed support for some federal regulations, including ones that protect workers’ health and safety and preserve national parks and other natural resources in the United States.

But, Trump said as he cut the ribbon on the massive stack, “every unnecessary page in these stacks represents hidden tax and harmful burdens to American workers and American businesses.”

The Trump policy is explained on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website where the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions is posted:

This agenda represents this administration’s next step in fundamental regulatory reform and a reorientation toward reducing unnecessary regulatory burden on the American people. By amending and eliminating regulations that are ineffective, duplicative, and obsolete, the Administration can promote economic growth and innovation and protect individual liberty.

The numbers show that 1,579 regulations have been withdrawn or put in “delayed action status.”

Critics, however, have challenged Trump’s claims, according to AP.

Stuart Shapiro, a Rutgers University professor who worked at the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during the Clinton and Bush presidencies, is one of them.

“There’s some reality there and a lot of bluster,” Shapiro said, adding that deregulating rules is just as time-consuming as adding new regulations and nothing is certain until the process is complete.New York Magazine’s Ed Kilgore looks at the fall of the Never Trump movement one year later.

From NY Magazine:

The #NeverTrump Republicans, who were a formidable force in 2016, even after the mogul became the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, are a much-reduced group now. And those who have not either reconciled themselves to the 45th president or resolved to support Democrats (at least until Trump is deposed from leadership of the GOP) have a very bleak future.

Kilgore specifically addresses “one of the most resolute #NeverTrumpers” and “ultrapartisan writer” Jennifer Rubin of the Washington Post and her call for a 2020 Never Trump presidential candidate:

No, a “center-right” third/independent ticket in 2020 is not a lively prospect. If Jennifer Rubin doesn’t want to participate in what even she regards as a kamikaze mission to take back her old party, she needs to suck it up and join the other one. That’s the only alternative to just consigning herself like so many other #NeverTrumpers to the political margins, making acerbic comments from the sidelines while the real game is played by Republicans and Democrats.

“During National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to eradicating the evil of enslavement,” President Trump wrote in the official proclamation. “Human trafficking is a modern form of the oldest and most barbaric type of exploitation. It has no place in our world.”

“We also pledge to do all in our power to end the horrific practice of human trafficking that plagues innocent victims around the world,” the president continued.

Trump said that about 25 million people are currently victimized in human trafficking cases that involve both sexual slavery and forced labor.

“Human traffickers prey on their victims by promising a life of hope and greater opportunity, while delivering only enslavement,” Trump stated. “Instead of delivering people to better lives, traffickers unjustifiably profit from the labor and toil of their victims, who they force — through violence and intimidation — to work in brothels and factories, on farms and fishing vessels, in private homes, and in countless industries.”

The president cited his executive orders focused on dismantling transnational criminal organizations that perpetuate human trafficking crimes. He said his administration will work with other countries, business, civil society organizations, and victims of human trafficking.

Administration departments including Health and Human Services (HHS), the State Department, the Department of Labor and others are being tasked to crack down on human trafficking and modern-day slavery.

The Department of State contributed $25 million to the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery. HHS is providing training and technical support to work with healthcare facilities in identifying trafficking victims.

The Department of Labor is being tasked with working with businesses by deploying a new mobile app supporting efforts to combat human trafficking.

In this effort, the president will sign S. 1536, the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, and S. 1532, the No Human Trafficking on Our Roads Act.”

“Our Nation is and will forever be a place that values and protects human life and dignity” President Trump concluded. “This month, let us redouble our efforts to ensure that (modern-day) slavery comes to its long overdue end.”The Donald Trump administration hopes to unveil a new Labor Department regulation in June requiring drug testing for unemployment benefits.

Republicans used the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal an Obama-era regulation that limited states’ ability to limit drug testing for people who apply for unemployment benefits.

After President Trump signed the CRA repealing the Obama-era regulation, House Ways and Means chairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) said:

President Trump just signed into law my bill that abolishes an Obama-era rule. After five years of battling with the Obama Department of Labor, states like Texas will now be allowed to drug test folks on unemployment to ensure they are job-ready from day one. This is a win for families, workers, job creators, and local economies.

Chairman Brady proposed the bill with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), who sponsored the Senate version of the CRA.

American unemployment claims remain at a 17-year record low, and American consumer sentiment reached its highest level since 2000, according to the University of Michigan.

Republicans argued that the 2016 unemployment rule only allowed unemployed Americans to submit to drug testing if they were in occupations that typically required testing, which includes airline pilots, flight crews, air traffic controllers, commercial and public transit drivers, as well as any job that requires Americans to regularly carry a firearm.

The Labor Department signaled that it planned to issue a more expansive rule redefining which jobs will have to submit to regular drug testing for unemployment claims.

In the Trump administration’s roadmap for new regulations, the Labor Department stated that “states no longer have authority to drug test unemployment compensation applicants for whom suitable work is only available in occupations that regularly conduct drug testing for unlawful use of controlled substances.”

The Labor Department said that it will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that “will identify the occupations that regularly conduct drug testing.”

Strategic Services on Unemployment and Workers’ Compensation President Doug Holmes said if they wish to be paid through state unemployment benefits, they need to make themselves able and available to work, and that includes passing a drug test.

Holmes suggested, “This is an insurance program, it’s not public assistance.”

Holmes then continued, arguing that the previous Labor Department rule was too restrictive.

He explained:

An individual has to be available and able to work. If they’re not available and able to work, week by week by week, then they don’t meet the requirements to be paid unemployment compensation benefits. If an individual has a significant problem that renders him or her unavailable to work, the appropriate response is to refer them to a place to get help. They should not be paid unemployment benefits.

The regulatory agenda said that the Labor Department plans to release its proposed rule in June.

Labor Department spokesman Eric Holland revealed that the agency is “diligently working on a new proposal regarding unemployment compensation drug testing that will be substantially different from the prior rule.”

“When it is ready, we will publish it in the Federal Register for review and comment by the public,” Holland added.Economists are finally admitting that the Trump presidency has been good for the economy.

A majority of economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal say President Donald Trump’s actions and policies have been somewhat or strongly positive for economic growth, job creation, and the stock market. Trump scores the largest number of “strongly positive” reviews for economic growth and the stock market.

Economists are very enthusiastic about the recently enacted tax bill, at least in the short term, with 90 percent saying it would increase economic growth over the next few years. They are more divided on the long-term, where half say the tax cuts will boost the economy’s long-run trend and half saying it would have no effect or slow the economy.

Very few economists believe Trump’s policies and actions have had a negative effect, according to the Wall Street Journal. None or nearly none say he has had a negative effect on economic growth, job creation, or the stockmarket. Only small percentages believe Trump’s policies have had a somewhat negative effect on long-term growth or financial stability.

Around half of the economists surveyed said that Trump’s policies would have a positive effect on the long-term growth potential of the U.S. economy. A sizable percentage said his policies would be neutral for long-term economic growth.

The results of the survey show a marked change since the election of 2016. Prior to the election and even shortly afterward, many economists predicted that the Trump administration would be bad for the stock market and the economy.

A year ago, economists were also pretty down on the Obama administration. More than 60 percent said the administration’s policies had had a somewhat or strongly negative effect on long-term growth. Forty-eight percent said that nearer term economic growth had been negatively impacted by the Obama administration, with just 35 percent saying it had had a positive effect.President Donald Trump has banned U.S. citizens from investing in Venezuela’s recently launched state cryptocurrency.

The order, signed by Trump on Monday, prohibits “all transactions related to, provision of financing for, and other dealings in, by a United States person or within the United States, any digital currency, digital coin, or digital token, that was issued by, for, or on behalf of the Government of Venezuela on or after January 9, 2018.”

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin also told reporters that the move would mean socialist dictator Nicolás Maduro “can no longer take advantage of the American financial system to facilitate the wholesale looting of the Venezuelan economy at the expense of the Venezuelan people.”

Regime officials have previously claimed to have raised $735 million during the currency’s pre-sale, although this figure is disputed by cryptoanalysts.

Maduro has argued the initiative will help Venezuela “advance in issues of monetary sovereignty,” mainly by bypassing previous economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration and other powers such as the European Union, although any form of major investment now appears extremely unlikely.

“It’s a pretty big blow,” Russ Dallen, the managing director at Caracas Capital, told Bloomberg. “Since most cryptocurrencies are not actually backed by anything real, cryptocurrency speculation is based on the greater fool theory – I can buy this at $100 because there is someone who is a bigger idiot who is going to buy it at $200.”

“When you take the U.S. out of that equation, you reduce the interest and potential for that speculation,” he continued.

The currency, backed by Venezuela’s extensive oil reserves, has already been declared illegal by Venezuela’s democratically elected National Assembly, who condemned an illegal attempt to mortgage the country’s natural resources to keep the increasing despotic regime in power.

The move is the latest action by the Trump administration to squeeze the Maduro regime, which continues to degrade democratic institutions while overseeing the worst economic and humanitarian crisis in the country’s history.

Before his removal as Secretary of State last week, Rex Tillerson said that the administration was considering blocking all sales of Venezuelan oil in a bid to weaken the regime even further.

The White House has already imposed multiple sanctions on the Maduro regime prohibiting Americans from dealing with Venezuela’s state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela (PDSVA), as well as personal sanctions targeting high ranking government officials including Maduro himself.

After teasing the release, he said: “Our new slogan … is going to be ‘Keep America Great!” he said as the crowd roared with approval.

The president said he loved his original Make America Great Again slogan, but that he already had to think ahead.

“I can’t say Make America Great Again because I already did that,” he said.

He emphasized that it was “our” slogan, noting that his supporters helped make everything happen.

“I mean, I look forward, I really do, I look forward to 2020 because I want to see how far left the person is going to be that we’re going to run against,” he said.

Trump urged Oprah Winfrey to throw her hat in the ring, saying he would “love” to campaign against her.

“I would love to beat Oprah,” he said. “I know her weakness. I know her weakness … I would love it. That would be a painful experience for her.”

Trump said that even if he coasted for the next two years, everything would turn out fine.

He specified that Republicans had to keep the House and the Senate in order for things to keep going well.

“We can only do that if we elect people who are going to back our agenda and fight for our values,” he said. “And that’s why we have to defeat Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters – a low IQ individual.”

Trump urged Pennsylvania to support Republican Rick Saccone in the special election on Tuesday.

“He’s a very fine human being. He’s a good person,” he said.President Donald Trump is planning to launch as much as $60 billion in tariffs against China.

The new tariffs will be a response from the United States to China’s intellectual property theft, according to the report from Bloomberg News.

The president continues to signal aggressive trade actions in response to the growing trade deficit with China.

“[W]e have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion a year,” Trump said during a political rally in Pennsylvania. “It’s no good. But we are changing it.”

China signaled concern about Trump’s proposed tariffs, warning of a trade war.

“No one will emerge a winner from a trade war,” China’s premier Li Keqiang said. “What we hope is for us to act rationally instead of being led by emotions.”President Donald Trump backed the House leadership’s short-term spending bill to avert a government shutdown.

White House principal deputy press secretary said in a statement:

The President supports the continuing resolution introduced in the House. Congress needs to do its job and provide full funding of our troops and military with a two-year budget caps deal. However, as the deal is negotiated, the President wants to ensure our military and national security are funded. He will not let it be held hostage by Democrats.

The 45th president tweeted on Thursday that a government shutdown would devastate the military and that funding for the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) should be part of a long-term funding bill, not a stop-gap spending bill.

President Trump tweeted, “CHIP should be part of a long-term solution, not a 30 Day, or short-term, extension!”

The president added, “A government shutdown will be devastating to our military…something the Dems care very little about!”:

CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018

A government shutdown will be devastating to our military…something the Dems care very little about! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2018

House Republican leadership proposed a stop-gap spending bill that will fund the government through February 16. The measure was offered in exchange for temporarily delaying several Obamacare taxes while funding the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for six years.

Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-NC) told Politico that enough no votes remain to prevent a stop-gap spending bill from passing through the House, assuming no Democrats vote for the bill.

Meadows continued, arguing that the short-term spending bill would continue to hold the military hostage, and increase spending. Meadows added that the short-term spending bill would also allow the Senate more time to craft a watered-down Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) illegal alien amnesty to the expense of conservatives who want funding for a southern border wall, as well as an end to chain migration and the diversity visa lottery.

House conservatives hope to seize the current window to force a vote on the Goodlatte-Labrador immigration bill.

Rep. Scott Perry (R-PA), a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Wednesday, “First of all, I’d like to get our House bill on immigration enforcement passed. That’s a minimum standard. That’s No. 1.”

Congressman Dave Brat (R-VA) argued, “We don’t wanna get rolled by the Senate on DACA and the budget.”President Donald Trump is preparing to announce steel and aluminum tariffs on Thursday.

“Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs revealed that Trump may increase tariffs by as much as 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium.

Scoop: Trump is set to announce steep tariffs on steel and aluminum imports Thursday — and he has told aides he wants 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, sources tell me, @JoeDeaux and @andrewmayeda. — Jennifer Jacobs (@JenniferJJacobs) March 1, 2018

The president has long sought tough trade actions and tariffs in his administration, but the contentious issue remains elusive.

“We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer,” he said. “We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!”

Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 1, 2018

The move would be a significant challenge to China, which continues to flood the U.S. market with cheap steel and aluminum.

In February, the Commerce Department led by Wilbur Ross, concluded a study that said the imports threatened national security.

Trump met with concerned members of Congress on February 13, saying that he appreciated the need for cheap steel for manufacturing, but felt that the steel industry in the United States was “decimated” by sustained cheap foreign imports.

“You have countries that are so overproducing, and what they’re doing is they are dumping it on us,” he said. “And you look at empty factories, steel factories, and plants, and it’s a very sad thing to look at.”President Donald Trump quickly signed the Congressional two-year spending deal on Friday, just hours after it passed the House of Representatives in an early morning vote.

“Just signed Bill,” Trump announced on Twitter. “Our Military will now be stronger than ever before.”

The president focused on the big boost to military spending as a win for Republicans.

“We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more,” he wrote. “First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!”

The Republican budget deal with Democrats raises spending by $300 billion — roughly $165 billion in military spending and $131 billion to domestic spending. The bill also offers $90 billion in hurricane relief for Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico.

Trump acknowledged that the bill was expensive, but appeared to accept it as part of the dealmaking process. He urged Americans to vote for more Republicans in 2018.

“Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military,” he wrote. “Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!”

Trump continued to praise the bill as a victory, because of the big spending boost to the military. He criticized Democrats for “waste” in the bill.

“Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond,” he said. “This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes.”

Trump also appeared grateful that the Democrats did not shut down the government over amnesty for DACA recipients.

“Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!” he concluded.President Donald Trump recognized African American History Month on Tuesday, celebrating the story of an American soldier who sacrificed to preserve the American flag.

The president told the story of Sgt. William Carney, the first African-American Medal of Honor recipient. Carney, a former slave, was recognized for rushing to save the American flag from touching the ground, despite taking multiple gunshot wounds.

“He later remarked to his comrades that the old flag never touched the ground,” Trump said, referring to Carney’s story. “That’s a big deal.”

Trump made his remarks at a reception at the White House for African American history month. The evening had a special theme, honoring African American soldiers in the military. He also singled out Charles Nesby Jr., an African-American Top Gun pilot and instructor, for recognition.

Trump also recognized famous civil rights heroes Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Booker T. Washington, Rosa Parks, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

“African-American civil rights champions have brought out the best in America, calling us to live up to our founding creed and the truth that we are all made equal by God,” Trump said.Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) said she is ready for pushback from Breitbart News while she ramps up her efforts to impeach President Donald Trump.

Waters told Elle magazine days after her State of the Union response that she follows Breitbart News’s critical reporting on her antics.

According to Elle’s puff piece, Waters “touched on the attacks that the Republican party and, in particular, Breitbart have launched against her—she noted that she’s frequently referred to as Mad Max.”

“When you make a decision, and you know that decision is controversial, you know that you’re going be up against people who are going to fire back at you,” she reportedly said. “I’m prepared to suffer the consequences of my actions, and I don’t fall backwards into this stuff. And so, the consequences will be there, but I’m prepared to deal with that.”

Breitbart News was on Waters’s mind last year at a House Financial Services Committee hearing when she actually accused Breitbart News of wanting to kill her.

“They’re on the Internet; they’re Breitbart,” she said then. “If you look at the YouTube, you see how much they want to kill me and others. What can we do?”

Waters also used her response to Trump’s State of the Union address last week to call for Trump’s immediate impeachment while saying Trump is “a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist.”

”Increasingly, millions of Americans have recognized that Donald Trump is detrimental to our nation.”We deserve better. That’s why I have called for his impeachment,” she said on BET. “Some believe it’s too early. I disagree. The time is now. We must organize, challenge, and resist.”

Waters told Elle that she is at odds with her party’s leadership right now, though, on the impeachment issue.

“Now, the leadership has a different take, and what they’re thinking is we can’t get diverted from tax reform that we’ve been working on… The leadership does not want to be diverted into talking about impeachment,” Waters said. “I respect that they don’t necessarily think about it the way that I think about it, but I don’t let that interfere with what I do.”President Donald Trump commented on the rise of abuse and misconduct allegations in public society and the swift public judgments that follow.

“Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,” he wrote on Twitter. “Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new.”

Trump made his remarks after two of his White House staffers resigned amidst abuse allegations against their ex-wives. But Trump seemed sympathetic.

“There is no recovery for someone falsely accused – life and career are gone,” he wrote. “Is there no such thing any longer as due process?”

On Friday, Trump said he was “surprised” after Staff Secretary Rob Porter resigned as a result of abuse allegations from his ex-wives. The president made an effort to remind reporters of Porter’s reaction to the story.

“He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you have to talk to him about that, but we absolutely wish him well,” he said. “He did a very good job when he was at the White House.”President Donald Trump spoke with members of Congress on Tuesday about possible tariffs on steel and aluminum.

Trump said he was concerned that foreign countries like China were dumping cheap steel and aluminum on the United States, hurting the country’s steel industry.

“It’s a sad thing to look at,” Trump said, pointing to diminished steel companies and abandoned steel factories across the country.

Trump met with several senators to discuss the issue at the White House on Tuesday, including Democrats Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, and Ron Wyden.

During the meeting, Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt warned Trump that an increase in tariffs could spark a sharp jump in steel prices.

“We need to be careful here that we don’t start a reciprocal battle on tariffs,” he said. “We make aluminum, and we make steel in Missouri, but we buy a lot of aluminum, and we buy a lot of steel as well.”

Trump acknowledged that cheap prices for steel were important, but not at the expense of American industries.

“I look at it two ways,” he said. “I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminum industry, and we do need that for national defense.”

Trump said he was concerned about keeping the steel industry alive for national security.

“If we ever have a conflict, we don’t want to be buying steel for a country we are fighting,” he said.President Donald Trump expressed disappointment that the FBI failed to stop the Florida shooter, despite being informed about his dangerous behavior.

“Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter,” he wrote. “This is not acceptable.”

Trump argued that the FBI was wasting too much time investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, and whether or not his campaign colluded with the Russians.

“They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion,” he wrote. “Get back to the basics and make us all proud!”

Trump also responded to the mainstream media hysteria over whether he believed that Russia tried to meddle with the elections.

“I never said Russia did not meddle in the election,” he wrote. “I said ‘it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.’”

Trump continued, arguing that his presidential campaign did not collude with Russia to win the election.

“The Russian ‘hoax’ was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia – it never did!” he wrote.

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh revealed on Thursday that he plans to sue President Donald Trump over the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Frosh plans to join officials from New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to sue the federal government over the tax bill’s reduction on the state and local tax deduction (SALT). The state officials believe that the cap on the SALT deduction is unconstitutional.

Frosh, a Democrat, said in a press release, “By eliminating the SALT deductions, Trump’s tax bill will jack up taxes for more than half a million Marylanders,” Frosh, a Democrat, said in a news release. “It is an attack on state sovereignty and an attempt to cripple our ability to educate our kids, protect the Chesapeake Bay, and build the infrastructure that Maryland needs to be competitive in the world economy.”

Analysts believe that the legal challenge to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will likely fail, pundits argue that the federal government has broad authority taxes on income.

Meanwhile, the economy continues to expand under President Trump.

The economy added 200,000 jobs in January; economists expected the economy to grow by 180,000 last month. The unemployment remains at 4.1 percent according to the Labor Department. Average hourly wages jumped by 2.9 percent when compared to last January; this amounts to the largest increase since 2009.

UPS, Cigna, Hostess, and Lowe’s announced on Thursday that they will give their workers bonuses, increase investment, and give their workers free snacks due to tax reform.

Hostess Brands, the maker of Twinkies, announced that they will offer their employees a sweet deal: employee bonuses and free Hostess snacks for one year.

Hostess will give more than 1,000 employees a bonus of $1,250, which includes $750 in cash and a $500 contribution to their 401(k). The food giant will give their employees a multipack “product of the week” for free; local Hostess bakeries will choose which snacks to provide their employees each week.

C. Dean Metropoulos, the Hostess Brands executive chairman, said in a letter to employees:

The recent tax reform changes have given us the opportunity to review our benefit and compensation structure with an eye toward further investing in our workforce — our extraordinary team of employees who have and continue to help make Hostess so successful. As we have done in the past, the company’s management and board take great pleasure in sharing the company’s success with our employees.

UPS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer David Abney said in a statement, “This $12 billion investment program is an outgrowth of the opportunity for tax savings created by the Tax and Jobs Act,” said David Abney, UPS chairman and chief executive. “We will increase network investments and accelerate pension funding to strengthen the company for the long term, so that we maximize the benefit to our global customers, employees and shareowners.”The House Intelligence Committee’s declassified memo, released on Friday, reveals that a senior DOJ official’s relationship with the anti-Trump dossier author Christopher Steele and Fusion GPS, and the extent of his wife’s opposition research for the firm into then-candidate Donald Trump, was concealed from the FISA court.

The memo confirms that then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, was paid by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign through Fusion GPS, and Bruce Ohr’s relationship with Steele continued even after Steele was terminated from U.S. intelligence services.

The memo states:

During this same time period, Ohr’s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump. Ohr later provided the FBI with all of his wife’s opposition research, paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS. The Ohrs’ relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC.

In December, Fox News reported that a co-founder of the opposition research firm acknowledged in a court document that his company hired Nellie Ohr to investigate Trump.

The confirmation from Glenn Simpson came in a signed declaration filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., and provided a fuller picture of the nature of Nellie Ohr’s work – after Fox News first reported on her connection to Fusion GPS. Her husband, Bruce Ohr, was demoted at the DOJ last week for concealing his meetings with the same company, which commissioned the anti-Trump “dossier” containing salacious allegations about the now-president. Together, the Fusion connections for Mr. and Mrs. Ohr have raised Republican concerns about objectivity at the Justice Department, and even spurred a call from Trump’s outside counsel for a separate special prosecutor. Simpson’s statement shows Mrs. Ohr was indeed involved in the Trump research. He said bank records reflect Fusion GPS contracted with her “to help our company with its research and analysis of Mr. Trump.”

Simpson said he told the House intelligence committee that he met with Bruce Ohr after the election to discuss what information had been gathered about Russia and the 2016 presidential election.

Follow Penny Starr on TwitterPresident Donald Trump commented on the death of Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson, after a previously deported illegal alien driving drunk crashed into his vehicle, according to police.

“So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson,” Trump wrote. “This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST!”

Trump has signaled his willingness to give Democrats amnesty for 1.8 million illegal immigrants brought to the country as children, in exchange for border wall funding, an end to chain migration, and an end to the visa lottery system. The proposal is universally opposed by Democrats.

Fifty-four-year-old Jeffrey Monroe, the driver of the vehicle Jackson was traveling in, was also killed. Police say the man arrested for the crime, Manuel Orrego-Savala, is a citizen of Guatemala and was deported in 2007 and in 2009.

“My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken,” Trump wrote.President Donald Trump suggested Thursday that the GOP could postpone his immigration-and-amnesty push, and instead pass a no-compromise immigration rewrite in 2019.

“We have to get help from either side [to pass a bill in 2018] — or we have to elect many more Republicans,” Trump told GOP legislators gathered at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia.

Electing more Republicans “is another way of doing it,” he said, prompting cheers. He continued:

Really, that is another way of doing it. And based on the [election related] numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that … [Immigration] is now an election issue that will go to our benefit, not their benefit.

Trump said his four-part immigration and amnesty plan “includes reforms that are overwhelmingly popular with the voters, including Democrats … Americans want an immigration system that works for everybody.”

Trump’s suggestion is a 2018 threat to Democrats largely because Trump’s immigration priorities are far more popular than the Democrats’ pro-migrant, cheap-labor policies. By focussing the 2018 race on the nation’s current cheap-labor economic strategy, Trump could reanimate the blue-collar base that carried him to victory in 2016 and also trump the Democrats’ base of revenge-seeking liberals.

Trump’s suggestion of a delay also offers GOP legislators an escape from the amnesty debate, in which they are being pushed to vote for a very unpopular amnesty of at least 1.8 million Democratic-leaning ‘dreamer’ migrants. Unless Democrats suddenly relax their hardline opposition to reforms, the GOP legislators may quietly embrace Trump’s alternative strategy, and then stall and delay debate on the amnesty while pushing the issue into the November election.

A decision to punt the issue into November would also deny employers a flood of new immigrant workers. Without those imported workers, GOP legislators would benefit when employers raise wages for many American voters in the run-up to the November election.

But Trump’s threat of an immigration-election also shows that he wants to make a quick deal with the Democrats — if the Democrats can overcome their visceral opposition to Trump’s legal reforms and his border wall.

Also, Trump did not explicitly say he would take the immigration-and-amnesty issue to the voters in 2018 — even though the issue would likely be front-and-center in the election campaign.

In his speech to the GOP leaders, Trump complained that the Democrats are ignoring his four-part reform-and-amnesty plan.“We’re getting very little help from the Democrats, but I hope when I leave this room I get a call from these people saying ‘Let’s go,’” Trump told GOP legislators gathered at the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia.

You know, they talk a good game. We have to get help from either side — or we have to elect many more Republicans. That is another way of doing it. [cheers)’ really, that is another way of doing it. And based on the [election related] numbers we just saw, we have a real chance of doing that. You know ’18 is going to be very interesting. But we’ve got to do one or the other – either they’re going to have to come on board — because they talk a good game with DACA, but they don’t produce — … either they come on board or we’re just going to have to really work and we’re going to have to get more people so we can get the kind of numbers that we need to pass in a much easier fashion legislation [in 2019]. And to get it done [in 2018], we’ll all have to make some compromises along the way to get it done this way, Now to get it done the other way [in 2019], if we win more [seats], we don’t have to compromise so much, OK?

In his State of the Union address, Trump offered to back an amnesty for the 800,000 people who enrolled in the DACA quasi-amnesty, plus at least 1 million additional unidentified illegals who claim to have arrived as children before 2012.

In exchange, Trump asked $25 billion for his wall, plus legal reforms to fill up legal loopholes in border enforcement, plan an end to the visa lottery and to chain migration.

Ending the lottery and chain migration would trim legal immigration by roughly one-third each year, but only after 2027. The benefit for Americans is delayed because Trump’s offer also accepts all 4 million foreigners now on the chain-migration list.

Trump’s plan is sharply opposed by business groups which recognize that Americans’ wages will be nudged up if they cannot hire imported workers. Those business groups, including the Koch brother, have an outside influence because they provide a huge share of the party’s funding, and they are pressuring GOP legislators to actually increase the inflow of foreign workers.

The four-part Trump plan is also opposed by Democrats, who fear that the reforms will sharply cut the long-term inflow of government-dependent migrants. Also, Democrats simply do not want to publicly endorse Trump’s cuts and his border wall.

Aside from the amnesty, Trump’s pro-American immigration plans are very popular among the public, including among African-Americans who are a core element of the Democrats’ current electoral base.

Business groups, Democrats and the establishment tout the misleading, industry-funded “Nation of Immigrants” polls which pressure Americans to say they welcome migrants, including the roughly 3 million ‘dreamer’ illegals.

The alternative “priority or fairness” polls — plus the 2016 election — show that voters in the polling booth put a much higher priority on helping their families, neighbors, and fellow nationals get decent jobs in a high-tech, high-immigration, low-wage economy.

According to the White House transcript, Trump said:A new Reuters poll released on Monday revealed that nearly three in four Republicans believe that the FBI and the Department of Justice (DOJ) are working to “delegitimize” President Donald Trump.

Seventy-three percent of Republicans surveyed agreed that “members of the FBI and Department of Justice are working to delegitimize Trump through politically motivated investigations.”

Meanwhile, three in four Democrats believe that “members of the Republican Party and the White House are working to delegitimize the FBI and DOJ in the investigation of Russian tampering in the 2016 presidential election.”

This Reuters poll marks a drastic shift in Republicans’ view of the FBI and DOJ; roughly 84 percent of Republicans said in a January 2015 Reuters poll that they had a “favorable” view of the FBI.

The Reuters poll was conducted in the wake of the House Intelligence Committee memo that suggested that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the DOJ used the Steele dossier to spy on Trump campaign staffer Carter Page.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, argued during a conference call on Friday that members of the DOJ and FBI dressed up an opposition research document to “spy on an American citizen during a presidential campaign.”

The memo also revealed that the FBI and the DOJ allegedly failed to disclose the role of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and the Clinton campaign had in funding the Steele dossier.

House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement on Friday in the wake of the FISA memo’s release, “an American’s civil liberties may have been violated.”Department of Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross is urging President Trump to impose tough tariffs on aluminum and steel imports to protect American industries and increase domestic production in the latest effort to fulfill the “America First” economic nationalist agenda of the White House.

On Friday, Ross announced multiple recommendations to Trump on how to deal with the massive amount of imported aluminum and steel flooding the U.S. market.

For steel imports, Ross is asking Trump to impose:

A global tariff of at least 24 percent on all steel imports from all countries

Or, a tariff of at least 53 percent on all steel imports from Brazil, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, India, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam

Or, “a quota on all steel products from all countries equal to 63% of each country’s 2017 exports to the United States.”

Ross said in a statement that the steel tariffs are designed to increase domestic steel production to 80 percent from its current rate of 73 percent.

For aluminum imports, Ross is asking Trump to impose:

A tariff of at least 7.7 percent on all aluminum imports from all exporter countries

Or, a 23.6 percent tariff on all products from China, Hong Kong, Russia, Venezuela, and Vietnam

Or, “a quota on all imports from all countries equal to a maximum of 86.7% of their 2017 exports to the United States.”

“Each of the three proposals is intended to raise production of aluminum from the present 48% average capacity to 80%, a level that would provide the industry with long-term viability,” the Commerce Department wrote in a statement.

The trade recommendations by Ross are included in a report which found that China produces as much steel in one month as the U.S. produces in one year, as there are 169 antidumping and countervailing orders currently in place on steel.

The Commerce Department also found that the importation of aluminum to the U.S. has been coupled with a 58 percent decline in aluminum industry employment in the U.S. between 2013 to 2016.

Ross’s fair trade requests are part of a Trump administration effort to protect American industries from unfair trade practices and the detriments of free trade agreements like NAFTA, which have led to the gutting of working and middle-class American jobs.

As Breitbart News reported, Americans are increasingly supportive of tariffs in order to protect the U.S. and its workers from globalization.

According to Rasmussen Reports, roughly 50 percent of Americans said the federal government should “place tariffs on goods from countries that pay very low wages to their workers,” as opposed to only 26 percent of Americans who said tariffs should not be imposed on foreign countries.

About 24 percent of Americans said they were “not sure” if the government should use tariffs to protect American industries.

Additionally, a plurality of Americans, about 44 percent, said the federal government is not doing “enough” to protect U.S. manufacturers and businesses from foreign competition” from globalization which has been exacerbated by endless multinational free trade agreements supported by the Democratic and Republican party establishments.

Already, Trump’s announcement of a 30 percent tariff on solar imports has resulted in one Chinese solar company planning to build a manufacturing plant in the U.S., as Breitbart News reported.Politics will be in the spotlight again at the 2018 winter Olympics in Pyeongchang when Ivanka Trump, daughter, and adviser to President Donald Trump, arrives to view some of the final competitions and serve as the head of the U.S. delegation at the games’ closing ceremony on Sunday.

“All eyes are on any message Ivanka Trump might bring on behalf of her father, amid growing speculations of talks between Pyongyang and Washington following rare inter-Korean rapprochement,” the Korea Herald/Asia News Network reported.

The Network reported:

Her visit comes two weeks after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un sent his sister Kim Yo Jong for the opening ceremony of the winter games. On Feb. 10, Kim delivered the North Korean leader’s invitation for South Korean President Moon Jae In to visit Pyongyang.

The Daily Mail reported that South Korea will “roll out the red carpet” for Trump.

“The Chosun Ilbo, a major South Korean newspaper, reported Monday that Trump, also a top White House adviser, will receive VIP treatment when she touches down on the peninsula on February 25,” the Mail reported.

“The government apparently wants to soften her up, so [President] Trump agrees to a mooted visit to Pyongyang by President Moon Jae-in,” the article in the English version of the paper said, according to the Mail.

A South Korean official was quoted in the article as saying President Moon might accompany Trump ahead of the closing ceremony.

“Ivanka enjoys sports and especially skiing, so we are discussing having the president travel to Pyeongchang with her to watch a skiing competition,” a South Korean official said.

Moon and first lady Kim are expected to host either a lunch or dinner for Ivanka Trump before the closing ceremony, the Mail reported.

Aside from niceties, which will reportedly include gifts for Trump’s three children, there will also be diplomatic efforts aimed at getting the official stamp of approval from the U.S. on a North Korea, South Korea summit.

“With Ivanka Trump, the South Koreans can try again,” the Mail reported, referring to Vice President Mike Pence’s rebuff of the head of North Korea’s propaganda department and sister to dictator Kim Jong Un, Kim Yo Jong.

“Since President Trump cannot make it to Pyeongchang, Ivanka is his proxy and envoy,” one ruling-party official told Chosun Ilbo. ‘It’s important to win her support to realize an inter-Korean summit.’

The White House has not officially named the members of the American delegation heading to the closing ceremony, according to the Mail.

Follow Penny Starr on TwitterDuring the meeting with Parkland students at the White House on Wednesday President Trump said arming teachers is a step that can be taken to make schools less-attractive targets for attackers.

He said that as things stand, attackers have nothing to lose because no one can shoot back.

CNN quoted Trump saying, “Gun-free zone to a maniac—because they’re all cowards—a gun-free zone is ‘let’s go in and let’s attack because bullets aren’t coming back at us.'” He said adopting a policy where “20 percent” of teachers were armed would reduce or eliminate the perception of weakness, making schools a riskier target to strike.

Trump said, “If you had a teacher who was adept with the firearm, they could end the attack very quickly.”

Newsweek reports that Trump also emphasized mental health and raising “the minimum age for purchasing a firearm,” but the push for arming teachers took center stage.

Students showed considerable support for the idea of arming teachers. Hunter Pollack, who lost his sister Meadow in the attack, said, “I’m not here to debate, but I lost my sister. And like Mr. President said, if you could find 20% of maybe retired law enforcement officers, or a teacher who could go through discreet training to carry a firearm around his waist, it could’ve been a very different situation.”

President Trump campaigned on allowing teachers to be armed for self-defense. He said gun-free zones provide “target practice for sickos” and, on October 8, 2016, the Washington Post quoted him saying, “I will get rid of gun-free zones on schools.”

Marco Rubio (R-FL) told a CNN audience he does not support letting teachers carry guns.

Rubio said plainly, “I don’t support it.”

He suggested armed teachers could end up being shot by a SWAT team if that team entered the building and saw the teacher standing with a gun in his or her hand. He said, “The SWAT team doesn’t know who is who” so they may shoot the teacher, leading to an “additional tragedy that was unnecessary.”

Lost in Rubio’s scenario are two things: 1. Schools could keep specific lists of which teachers were armed – lists responding law enforcement could access so they would know who should have a gun. 2. He overlooked the agonizingly long minutes which pass between he time the attack starts and the time SWAT enters the building. At Sandy Hook the attacker had over nine minutes without armed resistance.

What are unarmed teachers to do for nine minutes?

Is it not safe to say that every death that occurs during that time is “unnecessary”?

President Trump observed that the status quo, wherein teachers are denied arms, is not working. CNN quoted him saying, “Gun-free zone to a maniac—because they’re all cowards—a gun-free zone is ‘let’s go in and let’s attack because bullets aren’t coming back at us.’”

Trump stressed that incidents like the February 14 attack could be cut short or prevented altogether if teachers were armed. He said, “If you had a teacher who was adept with the firearm, they could end the attack very quickly.”

Sign up to get Down Range at breitbart.com/downrange.President Donald Trump this week gets a Pentagon study which may recommend the government endorse the transgender ideology, despite his August directive to Pentagon officials.

The core claim of the transgender ideology is that the government should allow people to freely switch their legal sex to match their feelings of “gender identity,” regardless of their biology. If Trump accepts any recommendation which accepts that fundamental demand, progressive activist groups will quickly cite the Pentagon’s endorsement when asking judges to impose “transgender rights” on Americans and their children.

In practice, the transgender ideology requires women to silently accept men who “identify” as female in women’s bathrooms, showers, and sports clubs, and it requires parents to stand aside when their children decide to begin a lifetime of risky and self-sterilizing taxpayer-funded medical treatments to help them pretend they are members of the opposite sex.

The ideology is rapidly gaining power, aided by huge donations from wealthy individuals and medical companies. In Ohio, for example, in February, a judge forced parents of a teenage girl to give up custody so she can begin a lifetime of drug treatments and surgery that will allow her to appear as a male. Also, officials in New York and various universities have threatened to penalize people who do not refer to men as if they are women, and several judges have declared that Pentagon officials must accept recruits who want to change their sex.

There are some hints that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will try to dodge the issue by endorsing the transgender ideology while also excluding recruits who cannot deploy — such as people who are trying to change their sex via surgery and drugs.

“This is a deployable military,” Mattis said, according to USA Today. “It’s a lethal military that aligns with our allies and partners. If you can’t go overseas in your combat load — carry a combat load, then obviously, someone else has got to go. I want this spread fairly and equitably across the force.”

If Mattis pushes that dodge, he and his successors will face a series pro-transgender lawsuits and judges demanding that Pentagon officials actually implement their transgender endorsement by fully accepting recruits and soldiers who declare they have an opposite-sex “gender identity.”

If Trump accepts a pro-transgender policy at the Pentagon, he also gives up a popular and emotional issue that could help the GOP in the 2018 elections.

“I’m sure the President will carefully consider the information [in Mattis’ review] and if it is more one-sided that it ought to be, I’m sure he can order more information,” said Elaine Donnelly at the Center for Military Readiness. “Something as important as this is should be carefully considered.”

Trump has already made clear he opposes the transgender ideology and instead supports the nation’s two-sex society of equal, different and complementary men and women.

His appointees at the departments of justice and education have discarded controversial pro-transgender policies imposed by deputies working for former President Barack Obama. After the 2016 elections, Obama admitted his pro-transgender policies were so unpopular that they helped Trump beat Hillary Clinton.

In August, Trump directed the Pentagon to review Obama’s pro-transgender policies in the Pentagon:

In my judgment, the previous Administration failed to identify a sufficient basis to conclude that terminating the Departments’ longstanding policy and practice would not hinder military effectiveness and lethality, disrupt unit cohesion, or tax military resources, and there remain meaningful concerns that further study is needed to ensure that continued implementation of last year’s policy change would not have those negative effects … I am directing the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the U.S. Coast Guard, to return to the longstanding policy and practice on military service by transgender individuals that was in place prior to June 2016 until such time as a sufficient basis exists upon which to conclude that terminating that policy and practice would not have the negative effects discussed above.

Trump directed Pentagon officials to review the issue, and report back, ordering officials:

shall submit to me a plan for implementing both the general policy set forth in section 1(b) of this memorandum and the specific directives set forth in section 2 of this memorandum. The implementation plan shall adhere to the determinations of the Secretary of Defense, made in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, as to what steps are appropriate and consistent with military effectiveness and lethality, budgetary constraints, and applicable law.

The problem is that Mattis delegated the task of preparing the review to an official who developed Obama’s pro-transgender rules, said Donnelly.

The official, Anthony Kurta, has been the Pentagon’s personnel chief. But, said Donnelly, he has a long record of using the military to promote domestic social agendas, including government support for new legal rights for gays and for people who want to switch sex.

Under Kurta’s Obama-era policy, for example, female soldiers were ordered to give “dignity and respect” to transsexual men who join them in their shared shower rooms, according to training manuals leaked by soldiers in a mandatory class. But this “dignity and respect” was to be a one-way street, according to the training slides, which were developed by officials working for Obama. “Transgender Soldiers are not required or expected to modify or adjust their behavior based on the fact that they do not ‘match’ other Soldiers,” according to the slides, which were first leaked by TheFederalist.com:

Kurta may have finished the Trump review even before Christmas, ensuring that his Trump-appointed Pentagon personnel manager never gets a look, said Donnelly.

Opponents of the transgender ideology were apparently excluded from Kurta’s review, said Donnelly. “We don’t know who is on the panel, what kind of background they have, and we don’t know what kind of outside groups were invited in,” Donnelly said. “I don’t know anyone who has been invited to advise this panel of experts, although many of us have made our views known.”

“We are very concerned the President will not get the full range of information required to make a sound decision … and will only be exposed to one side,” said Donnelly. A process run by Kurta “is not the full and objective review that many of us expected … they should have appointed someone more objective.”

Robert Wilkie is the new undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, and Kurta has been nominated to oversee personnel policies under Wilkie, who is a former top staffer for GOP Sen. Thom Tillis.

Multiple polls show that most Americans wish to help and comfort people who think they are a member of the opposite sex but they also reject the transgender ideology’s claim that a person’s sex is determined by their feeling of “gender identity,” not by their biology.

Activists who support the transgender ideology claim that 0.35 percent of Americans are transgender. A study of the 2010 Census reported that only 1-in-2,300 adult Americans had changed their name from one sex to the other.

The progressive push to bend Americans’ attitudes and their male-and-female civic society around the idea of “gender” has already attacked and cracked popular social rules for how Americans handle the many charming differences between complementary men and women.

These pro-gender claims have an impact on different-sex bathrooms, shelters for battered women, sports leagues for girls, hiking groups for boys, K-12 curricula, university speech codes, religious freedoms, free speech, the social status of women, parents’ rights in childrearing, practices to help teenagers, women’s expectations of beauty, culture and civic society, scientific research, prison safety, civic ceremonies, school rules, men’s sense of masculinity, law enforcement, and children’s sexual privacy.President Trump told attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on Friday that he would like to arm teachers who love and want to protect their students.

According to the Daily Mail, Trump said, “When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones it just puts our students in far more danger.” His statement comes just over a week after Nikolas Cruz carried a rifle into a gun-free zone and opened fire, killing 17.

Trump said, “Well-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches and people who work in those buildings” should be allowed to carry guns to quickly end such attacks in the future.

Trump pledged during the 2016 presidential campaign to get rid of gun-free school zones. More than once, he indicated that teachers should be armed to shoot back at attackers and defend children’s lives.

On February 21, Trump began a steady push for armed teachers as part of his response to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) described the effort as “absolutely abhorrent.” According to the Hill, Blumenthal also described arming teachers as “an anathema.”

But Trump assured the CPAC audience that his push to arm teachers is based on teachers’ love for their students; because they love them, they will also protect them. Trump said, “[Teachers] love their students! They don’t want their students to be killed and to be hurt.” He described teachers as “patriots” who “could become schools’ first line of defense against crazed attackers.”

During his CPAC speech, Trump again mentioned a focus on background checks and mental illness, but he made no mention of raising the minimum purchase age for long rifles.

He did take time to point out that Democrats “will take your Second Amendment” if given control of Congress.

The president met with United States Governors on Monday, to discuss political issues — including how to stop school shootings from happening.

“You don’t know until you test it but, I really believe I’d run in there, even if I didn’t have a weapon, and I think most of the people in this room would have done that too,” Trump said.

Trump again criticized the Broward County deputies who remained outside the school as the shooter attacked.

“They weren’t exactly Medal of Honor winners all right?” he said. “The way they performed was frankly disgusting.”

Trump specifically mentioned Broward Country Sheriff Deputy Scot Peterson for not entering the school.

“He heard the power, and he heard probably the screaming and the bullets and he wanted no part of it,” Trump said. “That was a terrible, terrible job.”

The president revealed that he had lunch over the weekend with the NRA’s Vice President Wayne LaPierre and Chris W. Cox, the NRA’s Executive director of Legislative Action. He called them “patriots” who wanted to help stop mass shootings.

“Don’t worry about the NRA, they’re on our side … there’s nothing to be afraid of,” Trump told the governors. “And you know what, if they’re not with you, we have to fight them every once in a while, that’s ok.”

Trump again detailed to arm some skilled teachers with weapons.

“I want highly trained people that have a natural talent, like hitting a baseball or hitting a golf ball or putting,” Trump said.

He proposed the option of giving teachers an $1000 bonus, suggesting that it was an affordable way to make schools a “hardened target.”

“The bad guy has to understand there’s a big price to pay when they mess around with our students,” Trump said.Rep. Brian Mast (R-FL) is asking President Trump to enact an immediate “temporary ban” on AR-15 sales while Congress weighs whether to ban the rifles altogether.

Multiple Democrat Senators and Representatives are pushing an “assault weapons” ban and Rep. Mast used a February 25 Face the Nation appearance to push a specific ban on AR-15s as well.

Mast said,

We’ve seen a lot of shootings out there. We’ve seen what’s happened in Parkland, we’ve seen what happened in Las Vegas, we saw what happened in Orlando. And for me personally, it pains to know that I went out there, willing to defend my country, willing to give everything, with almost the exact same weapon that’s used to go out there and, unfortunately, kill children here in Parkland. And I think there’s very real opportunity here for response and for action.

It needs to be noted that an AR-15 is not “almost the exact same weapon” that Mast used. He used an M-16, which resembles an AR-15, but is fully automatic. M-16s have a selector switch on the left side of the rifle that allows military personnel to select their rate of fire–semi, full-auto, three round bursts–but an AR-15 is strictly semiautomatic. (Even an AR-15 with a bump stock only fires on round per each pull of the trigger.)

Nevertheless, Mast is pushing for a ban on AR-15s and, for now, is asking President Trump to put a “temporary ban” in place to give Congress time to act.

Masts suggests the temporary AR-15 ban be modeled after the terrorist travel ban. Of course, terrorists do not have a constitutional right to travel to our country but Americans posses a constitutional right to keep and bear arms that are in “common use” generation to generation.

Axios’ Jonathan Swan reports that, in private, Trump talks frequently about his support for the drug trafficking policies of Singapore and the Phillippines, where high-profile drug dealers are executed.

Swan spoke to an anonymous senior official in the Trump White House, who said: “He often jokes about killing drug dealers … He’ll say, ‘You know the Chinese and Filipinos don’t have a drug problem. They just kill them.'”

Additionally, five sources in the Trump administration have told Swan that the populist president sees drug dealers of the Mexican drug cartels “as bad as serial killers and should all get the death penalty,” Swan reports.

Singapore has some of the harshest sentencing laws in the world when it comes to drug offenses, giving drug dealers an automatic death sentence.

In the Phillippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has garnered support for his crackdown on drug traffickers, as Breitbart News reported, where criminals convicted of drug crimes are executed.

“When you kill criminals, that is not a crime against humanity. The criminals have no humanity. God damn it,” Duterte has previously stated. “There will be many more killings. They are really fighting.”

The opioid crisis continues to be a growing issue for America’s working and middle class. As Breitbart News reported, the average American’s life expectancy dropped between 2015 and 2016 as the epidemic of U.S. citizens overdosing on opioids hit a record high of more than 63,000 deaths in 2016.

American men were the cause of the drop, as women’s life expectancy remained steady at 81.1 years. For men, however, life expectancy dropped 0.2 years, down from 76.3 years in 2015 to now 76.1 years in 2016.

The CDC report also revealed that among American deaths caused by “unintentional injuries” — which include drug overdoses — the death rate increased 9.7 percent in 2016.President Donald Trump defended the National Rifle Association (NRA), as the left and the mainstream media blamed the gun rights organization for mass shootings.

“These are good people, in many cases great people, they are patriots, they love our country,” he said. “The NRA wants to do the right thing, I’ve been speaking to them.”

The president spoke briefly to reporters as he left the White House to speak at conservative activists at CPAC.

Trump said that he would fix the issue of mass shootings in schools, even though it had been a problem for years. He called for the end of gun-free zones at schools.

“You have to have a certain degree of offensive power within the school, it can’t always be defense,” he said.

Trump criticized Florida Deputy Sheriff Scott Peterson who resigned after it was revealed that even though he was armed and onsite, he did not engage the shooter.

“He didn’t have the courage or something happened, he certainly did a poor job,” Trump said, pointing out that Peterson was “under pressure” or “a coward.”Conservative radio talk show host Mark Levin told CPAC attendees Saturday morning that conservatives need to stand with President Trump and “defend” the presidency against the left.

“We are the first and last line of defense for this country. I don’t care if you agree with this president or not. It is our obligation to defend this man and defend this office,” Levin told attendees Saturday morning.

Levin said that even though President Trump is not a “philosophical conservative,” conservatives should still support him because he supports conservative policies, such as moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and fighting against sanctuary cities.

Levin added that as someone who writes books explaining American history, he sees that Trump is one of the few presidents since Ronald Reagan who is “serious” about shrinking the size of government.

“Not since Ronald Reagan have we had a man so serious about reining in the massive administrative state. It doesn’t have to be a philosophical issue with him,” Levin said, adding that it is important that conservatives support someone who combats liberals to ensure they do not define the narrative in this country.

“We do have a President of the United States who loves his country, loves its history, and we need to stand with him because [Democrats] want to take him out over our dead bodies,” Levin said.The Washington Times annual straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) has again found overwhelming support for President Donald Trump and his administration’s policies.

The poll found that 93 percent of respondents approve of the job Trump is doing, a seven percent rise from the figure of 86 percent last year. Seventy-five percent of attendees now believe America is going in the right direction, compared to just 44 percent of respondents last year.

“The conservative movement has found a new leader,” said Jim McLaughlin, who organized the poll.

Seventy-nine percent of people believe that Republicans in Congress should be doing more to support Trump, while 60 percent believe special counsel Robert Mueller has been unfair during the investigation into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election.

However, a majority broke with Trump on his use of Twitter. Though 35 percent said they wish Trump would tweet more, 40 percent of respondents wish he would tweet less; 13 percent said he has found a happy medium.

A total of 1,155 CPAC attendees participated in the poll, almost all of whom will have conservative leanings due to the nature of the conference.

Hillsdale College President Larry Arnn introduced McGahn as President Trump’s “primary adviser” on judicial appointments. President Trump came into office with a exceptionally high number of judicial vacancies and retirement-age judges, providing a historic opportunity to reshape the federal judiciary.

McGahn started by noting that the president ran on the idea of appointing conservative judges. “What the president looks for are excellent credentials,” he began, referring to education and what they have accomplished in the legal profession.

But President Trump focuses on evidence of a particular character trait as well.

“What the president likes are folks who have demonstrated some sort of courage, some sort of ability to stand strong in the face of adversity,” McGahn explained. President Trump looks for evidence that “once they get on the bench, [they] will not change and become someone else,” such as being susceptible to pressure from editorial pages and public-opinion polls.

President Trump is committed to “the notion of the rule of law,” the top White House lawyer continued, referring to judges who would faithfully follow whatever the words of the law are, rather than be “inclined to create the law on their own.”

Otherwise put, President Trump wants judges who have “demonstrated the ability to stand strong, as he has his entire life.”

“It’s not a coincidence” that President Trump ultimately picked Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court, McGahn gave as an example, adding that “Justice Gorsuch is going to be a tremendous justice.”

McGahn explained that a major item that “stuck out in his record” as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is that Gorsuch issued a broad-based opinion questioning Chevron deference. That is from the Chevron case, where the Supreme Court in 1984 held that when a regulatory statute is ambiguous or silent on a matter, courts should defer to any reasonable interpretation the federal government agency that administers the statute issues on the matter.

“Courts are increasingly deferential” to federal agencies, McGahn explained, despite the fact that Article I of the Constitution is explicit that “the legislative power is vested in the legislature.”

“Courts ought not defer to unelected agency heads,” McGahn argued, and praised Gorsuch for this lower-court decision where he “stuck his neck out on an issue.”

President Trump wants “a well-rounded, holistic person who understands the separation of powers” in the Constitution, he went on.

Gorsuch’s view of forcing Congress to reexamine laws instead of letting federal agencies interpret their own powers is “more consistent with the original text and meaning of the Constitution,” McGahn asserted, which is the bedrock of “the rule of the law and the constitutional order.”

In a wide-ranging interview meant to promote her upcoming spy thriller, Red Sparrow, Lawrence argued that Democrats made a “huge mistake” in their aggressive treatment of Trump supporters.

“The Democrats made a huge mistake by chastising the Trump supporters, and that was disgusting to me,” the Oscar-winner said. “Of course they’re not going to vote for Hillary Clinton; they’re going to vote for Donald Trump. You laughed at them when their plight is very real.”

Lawrence also revealed how President Trump’s victory invigorated her interest in politics. The Hunger Games star said she’s liberal and previously opted not to alienate huge swathes of her audience — as well as her Kentucky-based family and friends, who she admits don’t like her left-wing politics.

“I’ve always thought that it was a good idea to stay out of politics,” she continued. “Twenty-five percent of America identifies as liberal and I need more than 25 percent of America to go see my movies. It’s not wise, career-speaking, to talk about politics. When Donald Trump got sworn into office, that fucking changed.”

“My family obviously hates every time I talk about politics because it’s hard to see your kid get criticized and they live in Kentucky, where nobody is really liking what I’m saying,” she continued.

Lawrence, who has risen to become one of Hollywood’s most popular and recognizable actresses, is one of the countless celebrities vocally opposed to Trump’s presidency and claimed in December that she was “waiting” to throw a martini in the president’s face. Lawrence also made headlines in 2015 after she criticized Christians for wielding crucifixes like pitchforks.

Despite her hostility toward Trump and his supporters, the 27-year-old star revealed last year that she would take a break from acting in order to help “fix our democracy.”

“I’m going to take the next year off,” Lawrence told Entertainment Tonight earlier this month. “It doesn’t have anything to do with partisan [politics]. It’s just anti-corruption and stuff trying to pass state by state laws that can help prevent corruption, fix our democracy.”

In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes on Sunday, Lawrence also declared that she wanted to “kill” the disgraced movie mogul Harvey Weinstein after dozens of women accused him of sexual abuse ranging from harassment to rape.

“What he was did was criminal and deplorable and when it came out and I heard about it, I wanted to kill him,” she said. “The way that he destroyed so many women’s lives. I want to see him in jail.”

“A lot of people are going with this line of reasoning where they say, people in show business shouldn’t speak out about politics,” Jimmy Kimmel told in an interview with ABC News’ Paula Faris on Tuesday. “And yet … they elected Donald Trump the president of the United States. So I think that argument has pretty well jumped out the window.”

Most recently, the Live host has pushed political views like amnesty for illegal immigrants, gun control, and tax-payer subsidized healthcare — all while skewering President Trump and his supporters.

“I don’t think you can go too far,” Kimmel says of his politically charged rhetoric. “I’m still doing a comedy show and I need to be funny and entertain my audience, but I also think that we’ve matured enough … to the point where we can accept late-night talk show hosts speaking about a serious subject. And I think that it’s almost necessary now.”

The ABC star is set to return to host the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday and says he doesn’t have plans to crack jokes about Hollywood’s widespread sexual misconduct scandal during the show.

“This show is not about reliving people’s sexual assaults,” Kimmel said. “It’s an awards show for people who have been dreaming about maybe winning an Oscar for their whole lives. And the last thing I want to do is ruin that for someone who is nominated for, you know, best leading actress or best supporting or best director or cinematographer or whatever, by making it unpleasant.”

“I’m not going to stop any bad behavior with my jokes,” he said.

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonThe Trump Department of Education’s civil rights office has dismissed 15 of 19 complaints made by transgender students within the past year, says a report by Politico.

Between January 20, 2017 and February 21, 2018, in addition to the 15 cases that were dismissed, the education department ‘s civil rights office also has three cases under evaluation, and has resolved one, states the report following a filing under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).

“No complaints are actively under investigation,” the report adds.

The report comes following another report by BuzzFeed News in February which indicated the Trump education department would not be investigating complaints by transgender students who are barred from entering the bathrooms and locker rooms designated for the opposite biological sex.

Liz Hill, a spokesperson for the department, reportedly agreed with a statement that the department holds the position that restroom complaints from transgender students are not covered by the federal Title IX civil rights law.

“Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex, not gender identity,” Hill reportedly said, adding the department may investigate some types of transgender complaints, but not those related to bathroom use.

“Where students, including transgender students, are penalized or harassed for failing to conform to sex-based stereotypes, that is sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX,” Hill reportedly said. “In the case of bathrooms, however, long-standing regulations provide that separating facilities on the basis of sex is not a form of discrimination prohibited by Title IX.”

In January 2017, the Trump administration revoked former President Barack Obama’s directive that required school officials to affirm the claims of children and teens who say they identify with the gender of the opposite sex. The policy forced children in public schools across the country to share bathrooms and other private spaces with students of the opposite sex.

In 2016, a federal judge in Texas blocked the Obama-era directive and applied the ruling nationwide.

Polls have shown the Obama-era policy has had the support of less than 25 percent of Americans.Monday on CNN’s “The Lead,” former Trump aide Sam Nunberg called in to say that he will refuse to comply with the subpoena by special counsel Robert Mueller to appear in front of a federal grand jury.

During his wide-ranging interview, Nunberg told host Jake Tapper that he thought Mueller may have “something” on Trump.

Partial transcript as follows:

NUNBERG: I’m not cooperating. Arrest me.

TAPPER: You’re not cooperating, arrest you?

NUNBERG: Yes. You’re going to arrest me, arrest me. Do you know what? I’m not a fan of Donald Trump, Jake.

TAPPER: I know, you had a big falling out.

NUNBERG: I’m not a fan of his. When they start asking for stuff like this, Trump is right. It is a witch hunt.

TAPPER: When you did meet with the members of the special prosecutor’s team and you said they acted very professionally?

NUNBERG: They acted professionally and I was very impressed.

TAPPER: You were very impressed. What were they asking you about?

NUNBERG: They asked about everything in terms of my relationship with Trump, in terms of my — they even — you know, my father worked for Trump in the 1980s, if you read ‘Art of the Deal’ Trump mentions it. They asked about stuff like that. You wouldn’t believe it. And they know—they know something on him. And Jake, I don’t know what it is. Perhaps I’m wrong, but he did something.

TAPPER: You think that they have him on something but you don’t know if it is related to if Russians or something else.

NUNBERG: I think it, I think if they have him on something, they’re smart enough to know, if they have him on something, it has to be during election. Because the same way that they went after Bill Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas, and they were right to, they have to go, the minute Trump is a politician, they can go after him. Now, Sarah Huckabee has attacked me again and I’ll be more than happy to deal with her face to face. I would be more than happy to go back to court with her. I think she’s terrible, by the way.As the FBI is reportedly looking into Jared Kushner’s business dealings, Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) claimed Saturday on MSNBC that President Donald Trump is “acting lawless.”

Gallego said if Kushner was the son-in-law of a Democrat president, there would be “literal riots” in Congress.

“Just imagine a world where this is a Democrat president who has a son-in-law operating in the White House without security clearance and meeting with officials from all over the world while at the same time enter mingling his failing businesses and asking for business loans. There would be literal riots in Congress right now for hearings and potential impeachment. Somehow, the president and the Trump administration feels like they are above the law and are going to continue moving forward with this lawlessness that’s occurring in the White House,” stated Gallego.

He later added, “Unfortunately, in the past, we never had to do this. We had presidents, both Democrats and Republicans, that actually had some norms, they had some understanding of the rule of law. This president is acting lawless. This president is continuing to act lawless until there is a check on him. It has to be essentially the upcoming elections or, again, if we have Speaker Ryan actually do his duty under the Constitution to actually put in check the executive. I wouldn’t hold my breath.”

Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrentAn organization representing Venezuelan exiles has urged the Trump administration to impose an “urgent” oil embargo on the country’s ruling socialist dictatorship.

The Organization for Persecuted Venezuelans in Exile (VEPPEX) argues that an “oil embargo is a very important step for the weakening and isolation of the tyrant Nicolás Maduro.”

“Although it sounds paradoxical, an [oil embargo] would provide direct aid to the decent society that fights for a change in the country,” the organization said. “The money from the sale of oil to American companies is used to finance a tyranny that murders and tortures its citizens.”

VEPPEX made the request as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson concludes his tour of Latin America, where the issue of Venezuela’s worsening political, economic, and humanitarian crisis was high on the agenda.

In a series of talks and bilateral meetings, Tillerson has sought to gain approval for additional sanctions against the Maduro regime, now presiding over the worst humanitarian and economic crisis in the country while also becoming increasingly more authoritarian and repressive against widespread political dissidence.

On Monday, Tillerson confirmed that the U.S. was now considering blocking all imports of Venezuelan oil in an attempt to squeeze the regime, although some Latin American countries fear that additional sanctions could worsen a situation where people are already starving and without basic resources to live. The country’s monthly minimum wage is now equivalent to under one dollar a month.

“One of the aspects of considering sanctioning oil is what effect would it have on the Venezuelan people? Is it a step that might bring this to an end more rapidly?” he said. “We are looking at options and we are looking at how to mitigate the impacts on U.S. business interests.”

However, Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie has warned that sanctions “must never harm the Venezuelan people.”

The U.S. has already imposed multiple sanctions on the Maduro regime, which include banning Americans from dealing with Venezuela’s state-run oil company Petroleum of Venezuela, as well as personal sanctions against a number of high ranking government officials including Maduro himself.

During a bilateral meeting on Tuesday, Tillerson and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos also agreed that they would not recognize the results of the upcoming Venezuelan presidential election, which Maduro is widely expected to win having banned opposition parties from running.

“Our only objective is to see Venezuela return to its constitution, return its duly-elected assembly, and to hold free and fair elections and give the Venezuelan people the right for their voices to be heard in elections,” Tillerson said.

The editorial accused the FBI of using the FISA court and the phony opposition dossier funded by Hillary Clinton to influence the election.

It read:

We don’t know the political motives of the FBI and Justice officials, but the facts are damaging enough. The FBI in essence let itself and the FISA court be used to promote a major theme of the Clinton campaign. Mr. Steele and Fusion then leaked the fact of the investigation to friendly reporters to try to defeat Mr. Trump before the election. And afterward they continued to leak all this to the press to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Mr. Trump’s victory. No matter its motives, the FBI became a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law.

The Journal’s editorial called for the declassification of more documents and praised House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes for releasing the memo.

“[E]xposing abuses is the essence of accountability in a democracy,” the editorial read.

The paper was not entirely supportive of the president, recommending that special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation continue.

“Mr. Trump would do well to knock off the tweets lambasting the Mueller probe, and let House and Senate Republicans focus public attention on these FISA abuses,” it read.

On Saturday evening, Trump posted several truncated excerpts of the editorial on Twitter:

“The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath….The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier….the FBI became…. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 4, 2018The Donald Trump White House budget proposal released on Monday called for using the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare block grant bill to repeal Obamacare.

The Trump budget calls for an Obamacare bill closely modeled after the Graham-Cassidy legislation to be passed “as soon as possible.”

“The president is committed to rescuing states, consumers and taxpayers from the failures of Obamacare, and supporting states as they transition to more sustainable healthcare programs that provide appropriate choices for their citizens,” the budget explains.

The Trump White House explained why they believe that the Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal would serve as a great replacement to Obamacare:

The Market-Based Health Care Grant Program would provide more equitable and sustainable funding to States to develop affordable healthcare options. The block grant program would promote structural reforms to improve the functioning of the healthcare market through greater choice and competition, with States and consumers in charge rather than the Washington bureaucracy. The Budget would allow States to use the block grant for a variety of approaches in order to help their citizens, including those with high cost medical needs, afford quality healthcare services. The block grant approach also reflects the Administration’s view that Government subsidies are better targeted to States and consumers rather than funneled through insurance companies as with the PPACA.

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), wrote in a statement:

I’m glad to see there is no quit in President Trump when it comes to replacing Obamacare with the state-centered block grant known as Graham-Cassidy. I’m pleased President Trump is showing the same determination to repeal and replace Obamacare that President Obama did to pass it into law. It is now time for Republicans – and some Democrats – to rally around Graham-Cassidy. My goal is to get money and power out of Washington and give it back to patients and states for better health care outcomes.

The Graham-Cassidy Obamacare repeal bill almost passed through the Senate last year. The bill garnered endorsements from over 15 Republican governors as well as conservatives in Congress.

Sen. Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview that giving up on Obamacare repeal could serve as the “biggest mistake we could make in 2018.”Actress Retta said in an interview with Variety that her upcoming crime comedy-drama series Good Girls will appeal to women who feel “helpless” in the era of President Donald Trump.

NBC’s Good Girls, which is set to premiere later this month, stars Retta who plays a mother struggling to pay her sick daughter’s medical bills and decides to join her friends in robbing a grocery-store to raise the necessary money.

“There is a national vibe for women, and of feeling particularly helpless if you weren’t for Trump,” Retta told Variety. “I really feel like he’s the catalyst to a lot of things.”

“People are being more politically active, getting out the vote even, people are being more vocal about LGBTQ rights and women’s rights because they really feel like they got robbed,” the Parks and Recreation alum said. “Because there is this national feeling of, “The f—!?” I think it definitely helps that that’s how this show starts.”

Retta added that the cause she cares about most right now is the question of transgender rights, having previously mistaken transgender actor Laverne Cox for his brother.

The actress, who is also known for her work as a stand-up comedian, has previously participated in pro-abortion advertisements and last year was present at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner President Donald Trump declined to attend.

Follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart.com.The Trump administration proposed a plan that would deliver food items to food stamp recipients as part of their benefits package.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) noted that under the plan, which is included in the 2019 budget, those receiving more than $90 a month in benefits would receive “nutritious, U.S.-grown and produced food” in a “Harvest Box” that would make up half of a recipient’s allotted benefits for the month. The rest of the benefits would be placed on electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards for use at grocery stores as is allowed under the current SNAP system.

Budget Director Mick Mulvaney described the Trump administration’s “Harvest Box” proposal as a “Blue Apron-style program” where recipients receive food instead of cash vouchers.

The agency estimates that 16.4 million households enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) —about 81 percent of SNAP enrollees—would be affected by this policy.

Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a statement:

USDA America’s Harvest Box is a bold, innovative approach to providing nutritious food to people who need assistance feeding themselves and their families — and all of it is homegrown by American farmers and producers. It maintains the same level of food value as SNAP [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program] participants currently receive, provides states flexibility in administering the program, and is responsible to the taxpayers.

The USDA estimates that the proposal would save $129.2 billion over a period of ten years, would decrease food stamp fraud, and would enhance the nutrition content of the program.

Some food policy advocates questioned whether the Trump administration’s proposal would save the government money if the government were in charge of handling distribution, and expressed concern over how much choice SNAP recipients would have in what types of food they would receive.

“It’s a risky scheme that threatens families’ ability to put food on the table,” said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

A spokesperson for the agency told Breitbart News that individual states would determine what food suppliers to use for the boxes, how the food is distributed, and would be able to “regulate specific contents of the boxes.” The USDA spokesperson did not specify, however, whether recipients would have any choice in what is placed in the boxes.

The “Harvest Box” idea is based on an existing program known as the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, which utilizes local agencies and nonprofits to help distribute food boxes to “low-income elderly persons” who are at least 60-years-old. The program began under the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973, which the Nixon administration authorized.The media’s bizarre swoon over the crisp black suits, aristocratic poise, and “deadly side-eye” of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un’s sister Kim Yo-jong was stunning and offensive to sane people everywhere, but it is not difficult to understand. The media hate President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and will reflexively make common cause with anyone who can make them look bad. Along those lines, CNN ran a Trump and Pence-bashing piece on Monday morning sourced entirely to “a senior diplomatic source close to North Korea.”

In other words, CNN ran North Korean propaganda as a straight-up news story, without reservations or a single word of criticism. It’s tough to riddle out the strange way the source is identified, but it certainly does sound like a roundabout way of saying “senior North Korean diplomat.”

For instance, the “senior diplomatic source” said Vice President Mike Pence “degraded the image of the United States as a superpower” by meeting with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier, the father of Otto Warmbier, the American student whom the North Koreans abused and left to die during a year in their custody before President Trump arranged his return to the U.S.

The source further accused Pence of “undignified behavior” and taking “the low road instead of acting like a big brother” for refusing to stand and applaud the North-South Korean unified team at the Olympic opening ceremony. Asked what might bring North Korea back to the negotiating table, CNN’s source replied that “denuclearization could mean many things” and suggested “limited recognition or acceptance of its nuclear status” might persuade Pyongyang to suspend further missile and nuclear tests.

“Even a small gesture of respect, the source said, could have led to a diplomatic opening between North Korea and the US that would have helped to increase trust between the two countries. Instead, Pence was criticized by North Korean media, accused of not respecting the ‘Olympic spirit,’” CNN writes, displaying an impressive command of the North Korean newspaper beat.

If the CNN source is not a North Korean official, he or she has perfectly mastered the art of talking like a North Korean official, right down to proposing the kind of time-wasting “negotiations” Pyongyang has been using to run out the clock since the Clinton administration. One can only wonder why the source was not identified as a senior South Korean, American, or other national official with a deep understanding of North Korean thinking if such were the case.

The entire CNN piece is built around a half-dozen direct quotes and paraphrases of this single source, padded out with gushing praise for Kim Ivanka Yo-Jong’s charm offensive; she signed the Blue House guest book in Seoul with a message wishing for a “future of prosperous unification!” Squee! – and crabbing about Pence’s “stony” facial expressions as the charm offensive rolled along.

There is criticism of mixed messages the Trump administration is supposedly sending to North Korea, as well as a reminder that the administration has said a North Korean commitment to denuclearization is needed to restart negotiations – and lo and behold, the “senior diplomatic source” appeared to be offering just such a commitment, provided one is willing to grant that “denuclearization could mean many things.”

How can this piece possibly be of news value to readers without a less oblique identification of the source? A news report with a single named, or at least carefully identified, source can be fairly presented as an interview, albeit usually with more direct quotes than CNN offered in this case. It’s curious how often it paraphrases this enigmatic senior official or neutrally present information that was probably suggested by the source, such as what North Korean media are saying about grumpy Mike Pence and his insults to the “Olympic spirit” of Pyongyang.

“Whoever thinks that meeting defectors who bravely escaped from the world’s worst prison state degrades us must either have some strong affection for totalitarianism or just a knee-jerk hatred of Pence, with heavy emphasis on jerk,” Ed Morrissey of Hot Air mused about the CNN piece on Monday morning. The public needs to know a lot more about the jerks our media use as anonymous sources in the Trump era.President Donald Trump commented on a story about Sen. Mark Warner’s texting “with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch,” who also had ties to Hillary Clinton.

“Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch,” Trump wrote, referring to the Fox News story.

The president noted that Warner texted about avoiding a “paper trail” while meeting with lobbyist Adam Waldman in London. Warner wanted to establish contact with the author of the phony dossier, Christopher Steele.

“All tied into Crooked Hillary,” Trump wrote:

Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary. — Donald J.

During an event at the White House, Trump told reporters he was “very sad” by the news and reminded reporters that Porter claimed innocence.

The president said:

We found out about it recently, and I was surprised by it, but we certainly wish him well, and it’s a tough time for him. He did a very good job when he was in the White House. And we hope he has a wonderful career and he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it, and certainly, he’s also very sad now. He also, as you probably know, says he’s innocent, and I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he’s innocent, so you have to talk to him about that, but we absolutely wish him well. He did a very good job when he was at the White House.

Porter resigned on Wednesday. Details of the story have been the focus of cable news for four days, as new details emerge about how top officials reacted.

Porter’s ex-wife, Jennifer Willoughby, did an interview with Today‘s Savannah Guthrie on camera Friday morning and called him “verbally and emotionally abusive.” Colbie Holderness, Porter’s first wife, released photos of herself with a black eye that she said Porter caused by punching her in the face.

Others questioned the judgment of White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly for initially defending Porter before he resigned.President Donald Trump threatened a government shutdown if Congress did not act quickly to close immigration loopholes allowing MS-13 gang members to cross the border.

“Frankly, I’ll go a step further, if we don’t change the legislation, if we don’t get rid of these loopholes where killers are allowed to come into our country … if we don’t change it let’s have a shutdown, we’ll do a shutdown,” Trump said. “It’s worth it for our country.”

The president hosted a law enforcement roundtable on the threat posed by MS-13 gang members with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and other officials from the Department of Justice.

“I’d love to see a shutdown if we don’t get this stuff taken care of,” Trump continued.

Several members of Congress also attended — Reps. Lee Zeldin of New York, Martha McSally of Arizona, Michael McCaul of Texas, and Barbara Comstock of Virginia.

Comstock, who represents a Virginia district near Washington, DC, challenged Trump on his call for a shutdown.

“We don’t need a government shutdown on this,” she said.

“You can say what you want,” Trump said. “We are not getting support of the Democrats.”

Trump appeared frustrated after hearing stories from law enforcement officials describing how their hands were tied by existing laws that allowed catch-and-release and by minorities earning protected status despite hired smugglers bringing them into the United States.

“If we have to shut it down because the Democrats don’t want safety – and unrelated, but still related, they don’t want to take care of our military – then shut it down,” Trump said. “We’ll go with another shutdown.”

Trump also warned that MS-13 gang members took advantage of the loopholes in the legal system, allowing them to break into the United States.

He called for Congress to fund his long-promised wall.

“We need the wall, we’re going to get the wall, we don’t have the wall, we’re never going to solve this problem … without the wall it’s not going to work,” Trump said.

He said that foreign countries were “laughing” at the United States for its weak immigration and deportation laws.

“If other nations see what we’re doing, and they do watch what we’re doing, they laugh at us, they can’t believe that these policies where we can’t get people out that are killers,” he said.

He complained that it was frustrating that foreign countries who received aid from the United States refused to take back apprehended criminals to their countries.

“We give them tremendous amounts of aid, and they won’t take their killers back when we have them,” Trump said.

He thanked the officials after they spent nearly an hour talking about the problems they faced.

“I’m going to go through hell to get this stuff approved,” Trump said. “We have no choice.”Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) suggested that television networks display a parental advisory warning every time President Trump appears on television.

“Whenever he appears on TV there should be a disclaimer that says ‘This may be may not be acceptable for children,'” Waters said during a pre-taped appearance on political commentator Angela Rye’s State of the Union special on BET that aired Wednesday.

Waters appeared on the program to give her response to Trump’s address to Congress, calling him “unpresidential” and “racist.”

“One speech cannot and does not make Donald Trump presidential. He’s not presidential, and he never will be presidential. He claims that’s bringing people together but make no mistake, he is a dangerous, unprincipled, divisive, and shameful racist,” Waters said.

Waters accused Trump of using divisive language during the first year of his presidency and claimed he was a “terrible role model” because he hates women and minorities.

“After Trump defended white supremacists, targeted Muslims with his travel ban, described Mexicans as rapists, and mocked people with disabilities, it’s impossible to believe him when he tries to declare he wants to bring the country together,” she added.

Even though Waters appeared on BET to give her opinion on Tuesday night’s address, she did not attend the State of the Union in person out of protest.

The California Democrat has been an outspoken critic of Trump, telling MSNBC’s The Beat Tuesday afternoon that she boycotted the address to protest the president’s “character flaw.”President Donald Trump thanked supporters for watching his State of the Union address, boasting that the Nielson ratings were “the highest number in history.”

“Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech,” he wrote. “45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history.”

The 45.6 million number comes from the Nielson ratings of both broadcast and cable viewers and does not include video streaming. Trump’s ratings beat the trend of dwindling ratings for presidential State of the Union speeches but did not beat the record.

Only 31.1 million people watched Obama’s final State of the Union address in 2016 — although Obama’s first State of the Union drew 48 million viewers.

In 2002, 52 million watched George W. Bush’s State of the Union address after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bill Clinton’s first joint address to Congress in 1993 drew 66.9 million viewers — before video streaming.

Millions of Trump supporters tuned into Fox News, allowing the cable news network to beat every TV network for the first time in history.

“FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in,” Trump wrote. “Delivered from the heart!”

Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech. 45.6 million people watched, the highest number in history. @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11.7 million people tuning in.

Fox News posted an official ratings tally on Twitter.President Donald Trump vowed to border patrol agents that he would deliver a wall on the southern border, renewing his commitment to border security.

“A real wall, not a little wall … they have them; they don’t work,” Trump said. “You need a real wall that will work 99.9 percent.”

Trump made his remarks during a tour of the Border Patrol National Targeting Center on Friday in Virginia. He spoke to many of the agents and held a roundtable with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

Trump reemphasized his commitment to supporting the agents on the border and the DHS personnel.

“I just want to let you know that the Trump administration is with you folks 100 percent,” he said. “You have not been backed up properly, and everybody knows it. For political reasons, for lots of different reasons. But the Trump administration is with you.”

Nielsen agreed that a wall would be built, but specified that the money requested by his administration would be used to provide more border technology and agents.

“We’re going to build you one,” she said, referring to the wall funding request of $25 billion. “We have a very specific and targeted way in which we will use that money to build a border wall system. Just not just that infrastructure, but the technology and personnel that go with it.”

Nielsen even brought graphics to the briefing, showing Trump how border walls work.

“We’ve seen it, we have evidence, we know that they work,” she said.

Trump again cited the four principals of his immigration reform framework, which includes securing the border, closing loopholes, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.

ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan, who was also at the briefing, thanked Trump for visiting the facility and empowering his agents.

“For the American heroes sitting behind you, we thank you for letting us do our job,” he said.

He informed the president that since he took office, border crossings were at a 45-year low.

“That just shows you that when we’re allowed to enforce law, we’re going to have an impact,” he said.

Trump said lightly that it was a “great number” but that he was still “very unhappy” about it.

“That’s impressive nevertheless,” he said, as the agents laughed. “But you’ll do much better, good luck.”President Donald Trump rallied his CPAC supporters for the 2018 election campaign while offering Democrats no further compromise on his four-part immigration-reform and amnesty plan.

“I just want to tell you that we are going to win,” he said to the cheering crowd. ” I’d love you to get out there, work really hard for ’18. We need more Republicans to keep the tax cuts and keep all of this going.”

The president’s firm stance on immigration suggests he will not make any further compromises to Democrats as Congress tries to finish the 2018 budget appropriations, which were due in October. Without a GOP surrender on amnesty for 680,000 DACA illegals, Democrats will be pressured to launch another high-risk showdown if they want to stop the GOP’s 2108 budget’s appropriation of more than $1.5 billion for border-wall construction. The budget is due for completion March 23.

On February 15, nearly all Democrats worked with business-first Republicans to stonewall Trump’s four part-plan, which offered an amnesty to at least 1.8 million illegals in exchange for ending the visa lottery, slowly winding down chain migration, filling legal loopholes in border law and building a $25 billion border wall.

Democrats also allied with business-first Republicans to push for a double-amnesty plan that would have granted citizenship to more than 2 million illegals and blocked the enforcement of immigration laws against most illegals. In exchange for the double amnesty, the “Common Sense Coalition” would have created a $25 billion border-wall fund — but also buried the promised funding in a bureaucratic maze of reports and rules.

A group of business-first GOP Senators is now pushing a DACA-amnesty plan that would provide Trump with his border-wall funding — but no immigration reforms — while also delivering more cheap labor to business.

Trump cited all elements of his four-part plan during his CPAC speech, saying:

The Democrats are being totally unresponsive. They don’t want to do anything about DACA, I’m telling you. And it’s very possible that DACA won’t happen, and it’s not because of the Republicans, it’s going to be because of the Democrats. And frankly, you better elect more Republicans, folks, or it will never happen. (Applause.) The Democrats voted in favor of sanctuary cities. In other words, they voted to protect criminal aliens instead of voting to protect the American citizens. To secure our country, we are calling on Congress to build a great border wall to stop dangerous drugs and criminals from pouring into our country. (Applause.) And now they’re willing to give us the wall, but they don’t want to give us any of the laws to keep these people out. So we’re going to get the wall, but they don’t want to give us all of the other — chain migration, lottery. Think of a lottery. You have a country. They put names in. You think they’re giving us their good people? Not too many of you people are going to be in a lottery. So we pick out people. Then they turn out to be horrendous, and we don’t understand why. They’re not giving us their best people, folks. They’re not giving us — I mean, use your heads. They’re giving us — it’s a lottery. I don’t want people coming into this country with a lottery. I want people coming into this country based on merit. Based on merit. (Applause.) I want people, and we all want to be admitting people, who have skills, who can support themselves financially, who can contribute to our economy, who will love our people, and who will share our values, who will love our country. (Applause.) … We’ve got to change our way. Merit system. I want merit system. Because you know what’s happening? All of these companies are coming into our country. They’re all coming into our country. And when they come in, we need people that are going to work. I’m telling you, we need workers now. We need workers. (Applause.)

Trump described his immigration policy as a life-or-death issue for the country by linking it to his story of the woman who is bitten by a snake after she carries it across a river:

When I walked in today, did anyone ever hear me do the snake during the campaign? Because I had five people outside say, “Could you do ‘The Snake’?” And I said, well, people have heard it. Who hasn’t heard “The Snake”? You should read it anyways. (Laughs.) Let’s do it anyway. I’ll do it. All right? Should we do it? (Applause.) Now, this was a rock-and-roll song — little amendments — a rock-and-roll song. But every time I do it, people — and you have to think of this in terms of immigration. We have to have great people come into our — I want people to come into our country. And I want people that are going to help us. And I don’t want people that are going to come in and be accepting all of the gifts of our country for the next 50 years and contribute nothing. I don’t want that, and you don’t want that.

Repeatedly, Trump evoked the coming election, which Democrats hope will give them a majority in the House and the ability to block much of Trump’s pro-American agenda.

So we have to get out there and we have to fight in ’18 like never before — just the way you fought with us. Just the way you fought with us. You fought so hard, and you were so tough, and you were so smart. You were so smart. And you know what? I know for a fact you did the right thing, because we’re looking at the numbers. And the numbers — even they have to give credit for the kind of numbers that we’re producing.

Four million Americans turn 18 each year and begin looking for good jobs in the free market.

But the federal government inflates the supply of new labor by annually accepting roughly 1.1 million new legal immigrants, by providing work-permits to roughly 3 million resident foreigners, and by doing little to block the employment of roughly 8 million illegal immigrants.

The Washington-imposed economic policy of economic growth via mass-immigration floods the market with foreign labor, spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by blue-collar and white-collar employees. It also drives up real estate prices, widens wealth-gaps, reduces high-tech investment, increases state and local tax burdens, hurts kids’ schools and college education, pushes Americans away from high-tech careers, and sidelines at least 5 million marginalized Americans and their families, including many who are now struggling with opioid addictions.President Trump used a February 22 tweet to announce his support of “comprehensive background checks,” raising the age for long gun purchases, and banning bump stocks.

This is Trump’s biggest gun control statement to date, and it comes just one day day after he urged that we arm teachers to reduce the gun-free status of school’s around the nation.

Trump tweeted:

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue – I hope! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

“Comprehensive background checks” often mean universal background checks, but it is unclear whether that is Trump’s position here. His emphasis on “mental health” means he may be talking about overhauling our current background check system, rather than expanding it.

Democrats push for expanding background checks after every high profile shooting, even though high profile shooters almost always acquire their guns via background checks. Florida school gunman Nikolas Cruz acquired his gun via a background check.

On September 18, 2015, while campaigning for president, Trump made clear that he would not support an expansion of background checks. He hedged this pledge on the fact that we have had background checks since 1998 and they have not lived up to the promises of safety and crime prevention issued at the time of enactment.

In other words, background checks have been a fail, so why expand them?

Trump’s push to raise the minimum of age for long gun purchases from 18-years-old to 21 is almost certain to happen, and his support of bump stock gun control shared by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and other members of the GOP, making it likely.

Bump stocks do not convert semiautomatic rifles into fully automatic rifles and they were not used in the Florida school shooting, In fact, the October 1, 2017, Las Vegas attack was the only high profile shooting on record in which bump stocks were used. Yet they are increasingly targeted for a ban as the gun control outcry continues.

To put it another way, a bump stock ban would have done absolutely nothing to prevent the Florida school attack, Texas church attack (November 5, 2017), the Alexandria attack (June 14, 2017), the Orlando attack (June 12, 2016), the San Bernardino attack (December 2, 2015), the Umpqua Community College attack (October 1, 2015), the Lafayette movie theater attack (July 23, 2015), the Chattanooga attack (July 16, 2015), the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal attack (Jun 17, 2015), the Santa Barbara attack (May 23, 2014), the Fort Hood attack (April 2, 2014), the D.C. Navy Yard attack (September 16, 2013), the Aurora movie theater attack (July 20, 2012), the Gabby Giffords (January 8, 2011) attack, or the Virginia Tech attack (April 16, 2007). But a ban of the firearm accessories is being pushed nonetheless.

Wearing one of her favorite designers, Mrs. Trump chose a crisp, black and gold Dolce & Gabbana merino-wool blend coat that features gold trim encircling her waist and lapel. Lined in Dolce & Gabbana’s signature leopard print, the coat gives an oceanic vibe (a nod to Australia) with decorative gold buttons, reminiscent of a sea captain’s uniform.

In another nod, the First Lady wore the Dolce & Gabbana coat — which retails for $2,157 at Farfetch — just as the Italian fashion house is set to showcase their Fall-Winter 2018 collection at Milan Fashion Week.

With ocean breeze hair and gold pointed-pumps, Mrs. Trump topped off this sharp look with a regal touch of effortlessness and simplicity.

“I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed.”

Trump faces staunch opposition in California to his project, despite Judge Gonzalo Curiel’s ruling that the administration could legally ignore environmental laws to speed up border construction.

The president is frustrated with California’s protection of illegal immigrants, even threatening to remove ICE agents entirely from the state.

“We get no help from the State of California. They are doing a lousy management job,” he said.

Democrats in Congress have blocked funding for the president’s wall, despite the construction of eight wall prototypes in San Diego.

“OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY!” Trump wrote.President Donald Trump signaled frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for requesting the Inspector General of the Justice Department to investigate possible FISA abuse.

“Why is A.G. Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse,” Trump asked, complaining that it would “take forever” and didn’t have the power to prosecute abuses.

“Isn’t the I.G. an Obama guy?” Trump asked. “Why not use Justice Department lawyers? DISGRACEFUL!”

In a statement responding to Trump, Sessions defended his actions as part of the “appropriate process.”

“As long as I am the Attorney General, I will continue to discharge my duties with integrity and honor, and this Department will continue to do its work in a fair and impartial manner according to the law and Constitution,” he wrote.

The decision by Sessions was featured on Fox and Friends on Wednesday morning, about an hour before Trump responded.

Trump has been dissatisfied with Sessions as his Attorney General but has resisted firing him. At one point, Sessions submitted a letter of resignation to the president but was urged to stay by former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus.President Donald Trump signaled frustration with Attorney General Jeff Sessions for requesting the Inspector General of the Justice Department to investigate possible FISA abuse.

Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to add her “assault weapons” ban to the overarching school safety bill during a bipartisan meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday.

Feinstein’s bill, which is an enhanced reintroduction of a bill she has put forward again and again, bans over 200 different firearms.

During Wednesday’s White House meeting, Trump showed support for the gun control pushed by Sens. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA). The Manchin/Toomey bill is a gun control bill that the Democrat-controlled Senate rejected on April 17, 2013. But Trump chalked that failure up to Barack Obama’s lack of leadership, and talked of using the Manchin/Toomey bill as a base to which other bills could be added.

The goal was to create a body of gun legislation, ubiquitously for the purposes of school safety.

Sen. Feinstein talked about her bill and described the AR-15 as one of “the latest and newest weapons” to hit our streets. However, Eugene Stoner designed the AR-15 in the 1950s and Armalite began producing the gun during the 1960s. Are weapons from 60 years ago now considered “latest and newest”?

Nonetheless, Trump listened to Feinstein, heard from a few more gun control proponents—including Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL)—then looked back at Feinstein and told her she should add her bill to the Manchin/Toomey bill for consideration.

Sunday on CNN’s “State of the Union,” when asked about reports President Donald Trump was unhappy with White House chief of staff John Kelly’s handling of the Rob Porter scandal, White House spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway said Trump had “full faith” in Kelly.

Conway said, “I spoke to the president, and he said, ‘Please tell Jake that I have full faith in chief of staff John Kelly and I’m not looking for replacements.'”

“It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference, we must actually make that difference,” Trump said.

He specifically called attention to mental health and promised to meet with federal and state officials to discuss the problem — but did not address gun control laws.

The president made his remarks at the White House after the shooting suspect in Parkland, Florida murdered 17 students before he was arrested and charged by law enforcement officials. He described the shooting as one of “terrible violence, hatred, and evil.”

Trump spoke directly to American schoolchildren, urging them to reach out to authority figures in their lives for help and to treat each other with dignity.

“Answer hate with love; answer cruelty with kindness,” he said. “We must also work together to create a culture in our country that embraces the dignity of life, that creates deep and meaningful human connections, and that turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.”

The president cited 2 Kings 20:5 to comfort those in grief: “‘I have heard your prayer and seen your tears, I will heal you,’” he read.

Trump thanked Americans who responded to the shooting, including the teachers who helped save lives of children in the school.

“To law enforcement, first responders and teachers who responded so bravely in the face of danger, we thank you for your courage,” he said.

He also confirmed that he planned to visit the Florida community in Parkland in the coming days.President Donald Trump decided not to golf on Saturday, despite being at his Palm Beach resort at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.

Bloomberg’s Jennifer Jacobs reported that the White House informed her of Trump’s decision the morning after he visited victims of the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida. They said he chose not to golf out of respect for the victims and those mourning the dead.

The weather in Palm Beach was sunny with a high of 80 degrees.

Trump’s golf club in Palm Beach is only about 40 miles away from the Parkland community where the shooting happened. Funeral and memorial services for the victims are still taking place in the community.

“Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Will never forget them, or the evening!”President Donald Trump called on Americans to have a “reflective” Presidents’ Day as they take time off for the federal holiday.

Trump does not have anything on his public schedule, but he plans to travel back to Washington, DC, from his club at Mar-a-Lago.

The president did not golf on Saturday or Sunday out of respect for the families who lost loved ones in the Florida shooting, but he traveled to his golf course on Monday.

He also met with House Speaker Paul Ryan on Saturday to discuss their agenda.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra is threatening to sue if the Trump administration includes a question regarding citizenship on the 2020 census.

The San Diego Union-Tribune reports that Becerra worries citizenship questions will dissuade some California residents from taking the census, thereby under-representing themselves and running the risk of a loss of federal funding for certain parts of the state.

Becerra is part of a coalition of 19 attorneys general who fighting against inclusion of a citizenship. They sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross on Monday, in which Becerra described counting everyone, citizen or not, as a “sacred responsibility.” He wrote:

What the Trump Administration is requesting is not just alarming, it is illegal. The Constitution requires that, every 10 years, we accurately count every person in our country, regardless of citizenship status. This is a sacred responsibility. It determines how many Congressional seats each state receives and how billions of dollars in federal funds are distributed. At the local level, it should also produce an accurate population count that our communities can rely on to identify the need for critical services such as disaster relief, infrastructure, public health, and police and fire protection.

Becarra continued:

The California Department of Justice is putting President Trump on notice: if a citizenship question is added to the 2020 U.S. Census Bureau questionnaire, we are prepared to take any and all necessary legal action to protect a full and accurate Census. This is clearly an attempt to bully and discourage our immigrant communities from participating in the 2020 Census count. We also call on Congress to fully and immediately fund preparations for the 2020 Census. California simply has too much to lose for us to allow the Trump Administration to botch this important decennial obligation.

California Secretary of State Alex Padilla added, “We will not sit idly by while this administration undermines yet another pillar of our democracy.”

“Americans need more choices in health insurance so they can find coverage that meets their needs,” said Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar in a statement on Tuesday. “The status quo is failing too many Americans who face skyrocketing costs and fewer and fewer choices. The Trump Administration is taking action so individuals and families have access to quality, affordable healthcare that works for them.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in October to expand short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. Before the executive order, Americans could only purchase these short-term health insurance plans for a maximum of three months; thanks to President Trump’s executive order, Americans can now retain the short-term health plan for any period under 12 months.

Short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with all of the Obamacare insurance regulations such as community rating and essential health benefits, allowing Americans to have more affordable health insurance options.

The HHS argues that this option remains more important than ever given that insurance premiums have more than doubled under Obamacare and that half of American counties only have one individual insurance carrier to choose from in 2018.

The HHS also found that short-term health insurance options remain more affordable than Obamacare insurance plans. In the fourth quarter of 2016, a short-term health insurance plan cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized Obamacare plan cost $393 per month.

In October, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised Trump’s executive order as “the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation,” adding that it will allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma claimed in a statement on Tuesday, “Americans who find themselves between jobs or simply can’t afford coverage because prices are too high will be helped by President Trump’s Healthcare for All Executive Order.”

Verma added, “In a market that is experiencing double-digit rate increases, allowing short-term, limited-duration insurance to cover longer periods gives Americans options and could be the difference between someone getting coverage or going without coverage at all.”President Trump “regularly asks” the pro-amnesty Director of Office of Budget and Management (OBM) Mick Mulvaney “his thoughts” on immigration issues, an exclusive report reveals.

According to Axios’s Jonathan Swan, Trump consults with Mulvaney on the issue of immigration, despite the director having no expertise or shared economic nationalist beliefs on the subject.

Swan reports, “Trump regularly asks Mulvaney for his thoughts on matters ranging far beyond his Budget portfolio, including immigration, healthcare, and what he thinks of certain White House officials.” [Emphasis added]

Mulvaney’s record on immigration is vastly separated from Trump’s roaring, popular economic nationalist approach to the issue, wherein illegal aliens are deported from the United States, the current mass legal immigration levels are reduced to give relief to Americans, and a border wall is constructed along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Unlike Trump, Mulvaney has been a voice for the big business lobby on immigration, rather than American workers, who are forced to compete with more than one million imported, mostly low-skilled foreign workers for U.S. jobs every year.

As recent as 2016, Breitbart News reported, Mulvaney was pushing his pro-amnesty, pro-mass immigration views on his former congressional website where he endorsed a plan to expand legal immigration into the U.S. despite the wage-cutting impact it would have on America’s working and middle class.

In 2015 video footage, Mulvaney can be seen telling a room full of his former South Carolina constituents that amnesty for illegal aliens is necessary, calling criticisms of the mass immigration “stupid” and “absurd.”

“We need to stop celebrating the absurd in our party,” Mulvaney said of Republicans who oppose amnesty and mass immigration. “And stop rewarding the outrageous and the stupid.” [Emphasis added] “We have to figure out how to deal with [immigration] as a party. We’re losing too many elections. We’re writing off too many people,” Mulvaney said, alluding to a plan that he favored which attracted Hispanics to the GOP by giving amnesty to illegal aliens and continuing unpopular mass legal immigration levels.

In 2014 video footage, Mulvaney proved himself to be an ally of the big business lobby, which favors mass immigration to the U.S., which keeps American workers’ wages stagnant and low.

Mulvaney pushed the false “there are jobs American citizens won’t do” narrative, which promotes mass immigration, both legal and illegal, as a solution to a society of Americans who are too entitled and not hardworking enough to do strenuous, blue-collar jobs.

“There are jobs that American citizens will not do,” Mulvaney told constituents at the time. “There are jobs that American citizens will not do. You can talk about why that is. You can talk about how our welfare state is broken and how we encourage people not to work. But that doesn’t help the farmer pick his [inaudible] for the summer.” [Emphasis added] “We have businesses that rely on migrant, legal migrant workers,” Mulvaney continued. [Emphasis added]

Mulvaney’s claims that Americans are unwilling to do blue-collar jobs has been debunked by a slew of research, which continues to find that nearly all U.S. industries continue to be dominated by native-born citizens, not foreign nationals.

For example, research by Steven Camarota found that of the more than 460 occupations analyzed, only four were dominated by foreign-born workers. Those four occupations accounted for less than one percent of the total U.S. workforce.

In jobs like housekeeping, construction work, butchers, and even taxi drivers, native-born Americans continue to make up the majority of the workforce.

Additionally, the agricultural and farm work Mulvaney talked about can be done by robots and machines, manned by American citizens. The big business lobby, though, prefers a cheap labor economy where foreign nationals are mass imported to the country to keep U.S. wages low and labor cheap.

Mulvaney was chosen for the OBM director position by Trump’s transition team in December 2016, just a month after Vice President Mike Pence was brought in to take over the team.

Under Pence’s leadership, a number of pro-mass immigration, pro-amnesty Republicans and consultants — the majority of which were members of the failed “Never Trump” movement — have been allowed to gain influence in the Trump administration on the issue of immigration.

For example, as Breitbart News reported, former Koch brothers executive Marc Short now runs the legislative affairs division of the White House, keeping close alliance to Pence. Short previously led a failed “Never Trump” effort inside the Koch brothers’ organizations.

Most recently, the Koch brothers, mega-donors to big business-first Republicans, announced their staunch opposition to Trump’s plan to reduce legal immigration levels to raise the wages of American workers and provide a better quality of life for the country’s working and middle class.

Likewise, last month, Pence invited anti-Trump, pro-open borders Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) into immigration discussions at the White House.

Friends at first are friends at last. https://t.co/fGS6FVY6xp pic.twitter.com/DpqcXp1H3T — Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) January 3, 2018

Soon after being brought in by Pence, Flake revealed that he and other pro-amnesty Republicans were working against Trump’s popular pro-American immigration agenda. Flake has remained one of the biggest proponents of expanding low-skilled legal immigration and continuing illegal immigration in the Republican Party.

Every year the U.S. admits more than 1.5 million foreign nationals, with the vast majority deriving from family-based chain migration, whereby newly naturalized citizens can bring an unlimited number of foreign relatives to the U.S. In 2016, the legal and illegal immigrant population reached a record high of 44 million. By 2023, the Center for Immigration Studies estimates that the legal and illegal immigrant population of the U.S. will make up nearly 15 percent of the entire U.S. population.Speculation over how long National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster can last in the job is ramping up after President Donald Trump corrected him on Twitter during the weekend.

McMaster spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, an annual global gathering of security leaders and experts in Munich, Germany.

During the Q and A portion of McMaster’s remarks, a Russian cybersecurity expert asked whether it was possible for the U.S. and Russia to have a bilateral security dialogue.

McMaster issued a lengthy rebuke to the Russian, first joking that he was surprised there was a cybersecurity expert there, given how active they have been.

“I would just say that we would love to have a cyber dialogue when Russia is sincere about curtailing its sophisticated form of espionage, what you might call this modern day sort of form of Maskirovka (Russian military deception), enabled by modern technology,” he said.

He warned that the U.S. was becoming more adept at tracing the origins of cyber espionage and subversion.

“As you can see with the FBI indictment the evidence is now really incontrovertible and available in the public domain,” he added. He continued:

Whereas in the past it was difficult to attribute for a couple of reason. First, technically it was difficult. But then also, you didn’t want to divulge your intelligence capabilities. But now that this is in the arena of a law enforcement investigation, it’s going to be very apparent to everyone.

McMaster then asserted that the Russian influence operations was not working to polarize American society and just appealing to the “big fringes” while uniting the rest behind Russia sanctions:

But the second reason is why I think Russia may re-evaluate what it’s been doing is because it’s just not working. So what’s happened is in this effort to polarize our societies, to support rightist groups, I mean, even the most extreme form of fascist groups and then groups on the left in an attempt to pit Western societies against each other, all that has done is appeal to those big fringes while uniting all of our polities actually against Russia and Russian interference. And so as you know, you might have heard in the United States it’s pretty difficult to pass bipartisan legislation these days for example across our parties, it is, it is pretty difficult. Except in one case, which is sanctions against Russia where the vote was 98-2. That was made possible mainly by Russia itself and Russian themselves in engaging in this campaign of political subversion.

Trump critics, journalists, and pundits pitted McMaster’s comments against the president, arguing that if McMaster could call out the Russians, then the president should be able to also.

Three hours after McMaster made those comments, Trump seemed to correct his national security adviser.

“General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

White House National Security Council Spokesman Michael Anton did not respond to a request from Breitbart News on how Trump’s tweet should be interpreted.

On Friday, Special Counsel Robert Mueller issued an indictment to 13 Russians and three Russian entities that described an elaborate plot beginning in 2014 to foment political division in the U.S.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a statement about the indictments that there was no allegation in the indictment that “there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.”“Elections have consequences.”

That is what Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said when he voted to confirm both of President Barack Obama’s nominees to the Supreme Court. He explained that although he would not have made the choices Obama did, he had to let the president lead, and respect his judgment.

But Graham seems to have a different rule for President Donald Trump, as he attacks not just the White House’s immigration policy, but also its personnel.

In January, Graham blasted presidential aide Stephen Miller, calling him an “outlier” with “extreme and unrealistic” views.

“As long as Stephen Miller is in charge of negotiating immigration, we’re going nowhere,” he said.

He repeated his attack on Miller this week, and lashed out at the Department of Homeland Security for its statement opposing Graham’s bipartisan immigration bill (which failed in the Senate this week, like the other three bills).

The administrative staff that a president hires to assist him with his duties, and the policies he directs the executive agencies to apply, are the most basic consequences of the election that put that president in office. These are not appointments that require Senate confirmation, nor are they policies that require the approval of other branches of government, as long as they stay within the laws passed by Congress and obey the principles upheld by the courts.

Stephen Miller is a hard-liner on immigration. So is Trump — and that is the reason Trump won the Republican nomination, ahead of 17 other candidates, including Graham.

It is also the reason the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been cracking down on illegal immigration under Trump. Graham’s compromise bill wanted DHS to ignore illegal crossings for the next four-and-a-half months. No wonder DHS opposed it vigorously.

In his complaints, Graham sounds disturbingly like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who told the president last month that there could be no immigration deal as long as Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) was involved, and also complained about the White House staff involved in the negotiations. Schumer and his party would prefer to negotiate with Republicans like Graham, who give them almost everything they want in the name of bipartisanship.

Actually, Miller, and Cotton, have shown that they are willing to compromise — to the point where Cotton even lost the endorsement of an anti-amnesty PAC.

Graham’s problem is not Miller, or Cotton, or the staffer who wrote the DHS criticism of his bill. His problem is not even with Trump, who hired Miller and set the new policies for DHS. Rather, Graham’s problem is with the two-thirds of American voters who share Trump’s views on immigration.

Graham is the first to participate in bipartisan legislation for its own sake. But he now refuses to talk to those who disagree with him on immigration.

On issues where Graham agrees with the president, such as national security, he has been effusive in his praise. But he is unwilling to accept that Trump’s election has any consequences for the immigration issue. And his rejection of the will of the voters is widely shared by his colleagues, who still refuse to put border security and law enforcement before legal status for illegal aliens, despite decades of legislative failure.

Not even the fact that a president has come into office with the clearest possible mandate on immigration policy has moved Washington to act. The issue will now, once again, go to the voters.

Perhaps the Democrats will be in for a surprise in November, after they squandered a double-digit lead. And perhaps Lindsey Graham will finally listen.

Follow him on Twitter at @joelpollak.Early Friday morning the New Yorker’s Ronan Farrow dropped an article that alleges a 2006 sexual affair between President Trump and Karen McDougal, a former Playboy Bunny. If the story is true, at the time, Trump had been married to Melania for a little less than two years and the National Enquirer purchased the rights to her story in order to kill it.

Naturally, in addition to the hysterical white noise and fire hose of anti-Trump fake news the deranged media is already spewing, they went crazy over this, which is only notable because it does mark a massive sea change in our media’s view of such things.

For 25 years, or for however long Bill Clinton has been a national figure, the media have trained/brainwashed Americans not to care about the following…

…a politician’s personal life.

…a politician’s sex life.

…a politician lying about sex.

…a politician’s extra-marital affairs.

…a politician lying about extra-marital affairs.

…a politician committing perjury to cover up an extra-marital affair.

Good heavens, we are not even supposed to care if the president of the United States has sex in the Oval Office with a young intern and is then accused by a handful of other women of sexual harassment, groping, and rape.

For 25 years, the media have told us we are electing a president, not a pope. So where did this sudden burst of moral purity come from? Why are we suddenly being told to care if a politician boinked a Playboy Bunny a dozen years ago?

Hey, need I remind you that we elected a president, not a pope!

The media’s new concern for individual morality is especially baffling when it was just ten years ago that we were told not to care if a politician smoked weed and snorted cocaine with his Choom Gang, if he palled around with domestic terrorists, if he spent 20 years in a racist church, if some sleazy local political operator helped him purchase his home, or if he was palzy-walzy with a raging anti-Semite.

Hell, ten years ago, the media cared so little about marital infidelity, they covered up for presidential candidate John Edwards as he cheated on his wife, who was dying of cancer at the time.

Time and again, whenever we thought these stories should be bigger news, the media reassured us that none of this matters, that it is all old news, litigated, and it was time to move on to what matters in the lives of the American people.

So, honestly, after 25 years of media training, I cannot tell you just how little I care about Trump’s 12-year-old sex life.

Furthermore, it is not like Trump has ever portrayed himself as some holier-than-thou figure — like, say, serial groper Al Franken. Trump being Trump is baked in the proverbial cake. Besides, something else we do not know is if he and Melania were quietly separated at the time.

This is not me making excuses for Trump. My only point is that we do not know what we do not know, and we most certainly do not know about the complicated relationship between this particular man and wife/ Therefore, the only motivation in condemning a man in such a circumstance is to feel superior by signaling your own virtue. Which makes it the perfect job for #NeverTrump.

Anyway, the media might have lost the ability to sway public opinion today, but after 25 years of being told not to care about these things — I do not care about these things, and the partisan media suddenly pretending to care only makes me care a whole lot less.

Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.Speaking at a rally in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday billed as “A Day of Action Against Trump’s White Supremacy,” Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) said the goal of the anti-Trump, pro-illegal alien movement should be “justice for all.”

“Justice for all,” Ellison said. “And that means whether you’re born here or not.”

“It’s really not about no politician, including me,” Ellison said. “It really is about the pressure you all have brought to this moment.”

“It is that pressure that is making everybody have to act,” Ellison said. “It is that pressure that is making everybody have to figure out what to do.”

“You’ve got to keep the pressure on,” Ellison said.

“You’ve got to talk about his message in Spanish, but also in English,” Ellison said. “Man, you’ve got to talk about this issue in Somalian, in Hebrew, in Arabic.”

“You’ve got to talk about this issue in any language people speak,” Ellison said. “The message has got to go out … which is don’t kick our people out.”

“I will not vote for anything that is not a clean Dream Act,” Ellison said, referring to legislation that proposed to grant amnesty to the estimated 800,000 young illegal aliens given temporary legal status and protected from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.

Full House at Dreamers Rally! pic.twitter.com/ROdqVcmrdG — Rep. Keith Ellison (@keithellison) February 7, 2018

Although the rally was organized by a number of left-wing groups, including the Women’s March, the message was decidedly about the millions of illegal aliens living in the United States who want the government to grant them blanket amnesty.

Cristina Jimenez, executive director and co-founder of United We Dream, which also sponsored the event, said that amnesty should be for all of the “11 million” illegal aliens living in the United States.

“We are here for them all,” Jimenez said.

Her remarks reflect the opinion of the Democrats and left-wing activists who have rejected President Donald Trump’s framework for immigration reform. The plan would provide amnesty and a pathway to citizenship for 1.8 million illegals but also includes border security and an end to chain migration that allows family members and other relatives admission to the U.S. based on relationships.

“What we have seen is a proposal from the White House that wants to separate families and implement policies that only favor White Supremacist ideologies,” Jimenez said.

“So when you have a White Supremacist Klan ruled over by the White House it is up to Republicans and Democrats — Schumer and Pelosi and members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the black caucus and the Asian caucus — to say we are going to stand in the way of a white supremacist agenda.

“You do not move forward another deal without the Dream Act,” Jimenez said.

As Congress tries to come up with a budget to fund the government, Democrats are insisting that the DACA amnesty be tied to any spending bill.

The rally advertisement on the United We Dream website blames Trump for the immigration debacle, even though he gave Congress months to come up with a legislative solution before the expiration of the DACA program and conceded more to DACA recipients than the much tougher House bill.

“From day one, Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda has ripped families apart,” the announcement said. “His latest proposal, crafted by political adviser Stephen Miller, pits immigrant youth against their parents, their family members, and other immigrant community members.”

The other groups sponsoring the rally include Good Jobs Nation, iAmerica Action, Bend the Arc Jewish Action, Center for Popular Democracy, United We Dream, National Domestic Workers Alliance, CASA, Make the Road New York, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Right, and Credo Mobile.

Some from the rally proceeded to a government office building where they chanted and blocked hallways as the Capitol Police worked to keep the situation under control.North Korean state media published reports Wednesday claiming President Donald Trump has a “nasty smell” and should “urgently be sent to a lunatics asylum.”

In a typically outlandish tirade titled, “Donald Trump Should Be Urgently Sent to Lunatics Asylum,” state newspaper Rodong Sinmun makes a number of rebuttals to Trump’s recent State of the Union address, where he shed light on North Korea’s appalling human rights record.

“In the recent ‘State of the Union Address,’ old lunatic Trump said that the DPRK is threatening the U.S. mainland by ‘reckless nuclear and missile pursuit,'” the article reads. “Not content with slandering the DPRK over ‘degeneration’ and ‘oppression,’ he took issue with the non-existent ‘human rights.'”

“This is the intolerable politically-motivated provocation and tyrannical blackmail of the boss of gangsters and hysteric fit of a lunatic against the DPRK,” it continues.

Trump, whose State of the Union address won plaudits from across the political spectrum, told the story of North Korean defector Ji Seong-Ho, who suffered starvation, torture, and the amputation of his legs as he tried to escape the communist state. Ji was a guest at the event and held up his old crutches in a defiant gesture against the regime.

The article goes on to claim that Trump cannot rid himself of the “nasty smell” from his “dirty body,” and warns that the U.S. could be close to its “final destruction.”

“No matter how desperately Trump may try to defame the dignified and just system in the DPRK with worst invectives, he can not deodorize nasty smell from his dirty body woven with frauds, sexual abuses, and all other crimes nor keep the U.S. from rushing to the final destruction,” it reads.

It is not the first time that the North has directly attacked Trump, last week describing him as a “lustful old man” overseeing the “worst barren land of human rights.”

Trump himself has directly insulted Kim Jong-un, describing him as “short and fat,” an insult to which North Korea claimed Trump has been “sentenced to death” by the Korean people.

Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend – and maybe someday that will happen! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2017

Trading insults has long been a popular tactic used by Pyongyang, who wish to portray their strength as they continue to expand their nuclear program and threaten war against America.

North Korea is currently undergoing a minor improvement in relations with the South, the U.S.’s closest regional ally, as the two countries engage in joint efforts for the upcoming Winter Olympics. However, little evidence has emerged so far that it will deter the North’s warmongering aggression in the region.

While President Trump’s job approval is on the rise and over 50 percent approve of his economic stewardship; while his State of the Union address grabbed more television viewers than any other since 2010 and received approval ratings of 75 percent — the firehose of Trump hatred spewing from Harveywood is bringing only ratings death.

The X-Files

The latest reboot of the iconic 90’s sci-fi series The X-Files received sparkling reviews upon its season 11 release earlier this month, primarily because the premiere episode was a super-woke attack on President Trump. The latest episode included a villain wearing a Make America Great Again hat and an alien informing Scully and Mulder that they will be building a wall to prevent us from going into space.

The alien explains, You’re not sending us your best people. You’re bringing drugs. You’re bringing crime. You’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people, but we have no choice. Believe me.”

Ratings result? The worst ever in the entire history of the series.

The Emmys

Back in September, Trump-hating host Stephen Colbert promised an all out assault against Trump at the Emmys.

Ratings result? The worst ever in the show’s 69-year history.

The Grammys

Last week the Grammys promised to deliver an all-out assault against Trump.

Ratings result? A 24 percent viewer nosedive due to 10 million fewer viewers, and an all-time low among younger viewers.

CNN

CNN has not qualified as a news outlet since 2016, as it is now seen primarily as a 24/7 Trump hate-porn cable channel.

Ratings result? In the month of January, not a single CNN program averaged enough viewers to place in the top 23. Anderson Cooper placed at 24. Only four CNN programs (barely) squeaked over a million total viewers on average throughout the entire month.

NFL Football

What was once widely seen as an American institution, one of the few remaining islands that brought the country together, has devolved into a divisive, anti-American playground for spoiled millionaires who only work 16 days a year to crybaby and Resist.

Ratings result? Disastrous.

Movie Attendance

Even as Hollywood has been exposed as a haven for sexual predators and their enablers, Hollywood has still piously devoted itself to the anti-Trump resistance, to hate and division, to attacking Trump and his supporters as Nazis and bigots.

Result? Movie attendance hit a 24-year low.

The American people are tired of the left’s politicization of absolutely everything, tired of this woke-culture where even a television super-agent breaks cover after she’s triggered by the word “darling,” tired of this unending and highly unattractive parade of uptight, joyless, humorless, judgmental, self-righteous scolds.

Margaret Dumont, Frank Burns, Niedermeyer, and Judge Smails used to be seen as the villains, used to be who we pointed and laughed at, and now these are the very people who, with all of their unAmerican qualities (bossy, humorless, pompous, sanctimonious, snobbish), are treated as heroes, icons, and role models. Good grief, these prigs have even managed to suck the fun out of football — football.

Nevertheless, nothing will change. It is not about the money. It is not about the ratings. And it is certainly not about truth or decency. The only thing that drives these institutions is hate for America and Americans. Those not driven by hate are driven by fear — fear of being blacklisted, shunned, and savaged should they not join the mindless hate-mob.

“The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans – something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Rank & File are great people!”

Trump made his comment on Friday, as the FBI braced for the release of the classified House Intelligence Committee memo drafted by Republican Chairman Devin Nunes. The four-page memo is expected to reveal improper surveillance practices by agents at the FBI and the Justice Department.

FBI director Christopher Wray has told the Trump administration that he opposes the release of the memo — even after House Republicans on the intelligence committee voted to make it public.

Trump also quoted Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton, who claimed that the Democrats used the Fusion GPS dossier to convince the Obama administration to spy on the Trump campaign.President Donald Trump again demanded wall funding in exchange for a deal on DACA, despite another Senate amnesty proposal from Sen. John McCain.

“Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time,” Trump wrote.

McCain and Sen. Chris Coons proposed a new bill on Monday that would legalize DACA recipients and order a comprehensive study for border security in exchange for military funding.

Trump urged Democrats to make a deal on DACA before the March 5th deadline.

“March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA,” he wrote. “Make a deal!”President Donald Trump criticized Democrats on Monday as “un-American” and “treasonous” for refusing to clap for good economic news during his State of the Union address. His criticism came during a visit to a company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to tout the benefits of his tax cut plan.

He noted that while he cited the lowest unemployment numbers for black and Hispanic Americans in history, Democrats refused to react positively.

“Dead silence. There was not a smile,” he said. “That means they would rather see Trump do badly than our country do well. That’s what it means. It’s very selfish.”

Trump said that during his address, he stopped watching the Democrats because it was “bad energy” for his speech.

“They were like death – and un-American,” Trump said.

He also said someone called their behavior “treasonous.”

As the crowd applauded, Trump continued. “Can we call that treason? Why not?” he asked. “I mean, they certainly didn’t seem to love our country very much.”

The president also ridiculed House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi for calling his tax cut “crumbs.”

“Well, she’s a rich woman who lives in a big beautiful house in California, who wants to give all your money away,” Trump said.

Trump compared Pelosi’s comment to Hillary Clinton’s description of his supporters as “deplorable.”

“She’s our secret weapon. I just hope they don’t change her!” Trump said. “There are a lot of people that want to run her out. She’s really out there.”President Donald Trump celebrated the fact that NFL football players did not take a knee during the national anthem at the Super Ball.

“There was nobody kneeling at the beginning of the Super Bowl,” Trump said. “We’ve made a lot of improvement, haven’t we? That’s a big improvement.”

The president even praised the Super Bowl, despite a history of criticizing the NFL’s new rules.

“On top of that it was a good game, so a lot of good things happened,” Trump said. “But there was no kneeling before that Super Bowl.”

Trump issued a statement before the Super Bowl on Sunday, urging all Americans to stand for the national anthem for the sake of the Armed Forces.

“Their sacrifice is stitched into each star and every stripe of our Star-Spangled Banner,” he wrote. “We hold them in our hearts and thank them for our freedom as we proudly stand for the National Anthem.”An article in the news section of the Sunday New York Times describing President Donald Trump’s reaction to the release of the House Intelligence Committee memo is a perfect example of how the “paper of record” is spinning the news to attack Trump — and divide the country.

The article, “Trump’s Unparalleled War on a Pillar of Society: Law Enforcement” shows why Trump supporters, and conservatives in general, dislike and distrust the media.

Written by veteran reporters Sharon LaFraniere, Katie Benner, and Peter Baker, with contributions from Maggie Haberman and Adam Goldman, the article is a group effort that reflects the outlook of the Times as a whole.

And It performs two dirty tricks. The first: the article casts Trump’s dispute with senior members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a fight with “law enforcement” as a whole, i.e. the FBI rank-and-file or even the neighborhood cop.

Note that this runs against a consistent theme of President Trump’s presidency, which has emphasized support for law enforcement — a clear break with the Obama administration, which often supported the Black Lives Matter movement and its criticisms of police. Trump has also offered unprecedented support for the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

To call his criticism of the FBI a “war” on law enforcement is just wrong.

The second trick: the article disdains evidence that the FBI and the Justice Department abused their power for political reasons. It notes that “Mr. Trump’s advisers” believe the memo “raised serious and legitimate questions about the way the F.B.I. used information gathered by a former spy paid by Mrs. Clinton’s campaign and the Democrats to help justify a warrant for surveillance on a former Trump campaign adviser tied to Russia.”

But the article never takes that belief seriously as a matter of public concern. To the team at the New York Times, it is just a political perspective.

What must be explained is not the FBI’s agenda, but rather Trump’s behavior, which is interpreted in the light of past interest in “secret document[s]” like Obama’s birth certificate. No past examples of FBI abuses — such as the surveillance of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., under COINTELPRO — are examined.

The article cites a number of “experts,” some of whom are almost predictable, like Trump-hating former George W. Bush official Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law professor. But to those outside the Times‘ liberal bubble, there is no way to dress up what is a blatant partisan attack masquerading as journalism.

Ironically, the self-assured, conclusory tone of the article suggests that the team who worked on it may have no idea just how partisan they have become.

The federal minimum age for purchasing a handgun is 21-years old while the minimum age for purchasing a long gun is 18. The ability to buy long guns at age 18 came under scrutiny after 19-year-old Nikolas Cruz carried an AR-15 into a gun-free zone in Florida and opened fire on students, killing 17.

Fox News reports that Trump is “open to…a rise in the minimum age for owning certain firearms” in the wake of the Florida attack.

This news emerged on the same day that Trump directed the DOJ to finalize plans to ban bump stocks amid the current gun control outcry. It also came on the day that NRP’s Mara Liasson asked White House Press Sarah Sanders if Trump would be willing to reinstate the 1994-2004 federal “assault weapons” ban. Sanders replied, “We haven’t close doors on any front.”

The Washington Post reports that the idea of raising minimum age for gun purchases came up while Trump was having dinner with Geraldo Rivera.

Riveria suggested “raising the minimum age at which a person could buy a semiautomatic weapon from 18 to 21.”

The AP reports the White House confirmed “the idea of raising the age limit to buy an AR-15 was on the table for discussion.”

On Monday, CNN’s Drew Griffin tracked down a private citizen whose worst sin might have been sharing — without knowing she was doing so — a “Russian-coordinated event” on her Facebook page. Griffin proceeded to publicly shame this woman, even though his left-wing employer gave a Russian-coordinated event more publicity than Putin could have ever hoped for.

Michael Moore was also at that rally and as of now CNN has not demanded he answer for his “unwitting” Russian collusion.

This is not the first time the last-place cable channel has attacked an innocent civilian. Over a silly video that mocked CNN, CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski openly threatened its creator, warning him that if he ever did it again CNN would “dox” him, or publish his private information so the Internet could abuse him.

Many accused CNN of doxing this woman. The anti-Trump network told the whole world her name and even chose not to blur out the address number on her house.

@donlemon hey Don, why did CNN ruin that Florida woman’s life? — Caleb (@dru55555) February 22, 2018

I reported @CNN for posting that doxxing video of the elderly Florida woman that has led to her being harassed on-line. I don't expect it to go anywhere. — Richard K (@AusRichie) February 21, 2018

Wow. I didn't even notice that. CNN had better hope nobody "visits" her. https://t.co/ciEsPyS6rJ — 🌈A Peter Of Color🏳️‍🌈 (@WamsuttaLives) February 22, 2018

CNN’s history of fomenting a climate of hate against conservatives and Trump supporters is well-documented.

Regardless, abuse is exactly what this Florida woman faced after CNN broadcast the video and published her name. On her Facebook page, she was savaged by CNN viewers as a “stupid old hag,” a “traitor,” a “treasonous hillbilly,” “ugly,” and “racist trash.”

The woman was also physically threatened. “[S]tay in Florida, you come to NY and I’ll kick your Russian bot ass,” one CNN consumer promised.

Among others, and although they are men of the left, MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and the Intercept’s Glenn Greenwald were disgusted and appalled by CNN’s abusive bullying of this innocent woman.

In a series of tweets, Hayes said, “I think it’s bad CNN did this and don’t approve and wouldn’t do it myself.” He added, “That is awful and they should not have done it. … Doorknocking a random citizen not accused of any wrongdoing like that is not cool.”

That is awful and they should not have done it. In fact the video came up in our editorial meeting and I said we are definitely not showing it. Doorknocking a random citizen not accused of any wrongdoing like that is not cool. — Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) February 21, 2018

Greenwald was even more outraged, declaring CNN’s partisan tactics “vile,” “gross,” and ‘despicable.”

“Despicable: CNN hunts down an ordinary citizen at home … Go ask Michael Moore why he did that. Ask Joy Reid why Russian bots RT her so much.” In another tweet, he added, “One last thing that is vile about what CNN did. This reporter would *never* show up uninvited at the home of, say, Obama military or intel officials & ambush them with cameras. They’d respectfully invite them into studios & allow them to decline. So easy to confront the powerless[.]”

Follow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC. Follow his Facebook Page here.President Trump observed that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes” away when a school shooting occurs, but teachers are on scene to shoot sickos “immediately.”

This is the first reiteration of his February 21 call to arm approximately “20 percent” of schools as a way to enhance school safety.

Early Thursday morning, Trump segued to the topic of arming teachers by correcting “Fake News” claims. After setting the record straight, he reaffirmed his support for armed teachers:

I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience – only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

….immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 22, 2018

Trump’s points are simple: 1. He is not talking about haphazardly providing guns to teachers. Rather, he is talking about shifting from a gun-free paradigm by training certain teachers to carry for the defense of themselves and their students. 2. It is demonstrable that first responders are minutes away when an attack occurs, but teachers are on the scene the second the attack begins. Allowing teachers to take action–and giving them the training needed to do so effectively–will save lives. 3. Gun-free zones are killing fields and serve “a magnet for bad people.” Eliminating such zones will eliminate, or at least diminish, the attractiveness of schools as targets.

He said, “They will take away those massive tax cuts and they will take away your Second Amendment.”

After mentioning tax cuts and the Second Amendment, Trump asked the crowd which was most important to them. By applause they indicated the Second Amendment and he smiled, acknowledged their preference, and said, “We’re going to say you want the Second Amendment the most.”

Trump’s CPAC speech comes amid his push to arm “20 percent” of public school teachers as a way to make schools safer. He introduced the plan on Wednesday then reiterated it on Thursday, noting that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes away,” but teachers can shoot sickos “immediately.”The Trump administration launched a new rule on Tuesday that will expand short-term health insurance plans, offering Americans more affordable health care options compared to Obamacare.

“Americans need more choices in health insurance so they can find coverage that meets their needs,” said Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar in a statement on Tuesday. “The status quo is failing too many Americans who face skyrocketing costs and fewer and fewer choices. The Trump Administration is taking action so individuals and families have access to quality, affordable healthcare that works for them.”

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in October to expand short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans. Before the executive order, Americans could only purchase these short-term health insurance plans for a maximum of three months; thanks to President Trump’s executive order, Americans can now retain the short-term health plan for any period under 12 months.

Short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with all of the Obamacare insurance regulations such as community rating and essential health benefits, allowing Americans to have more affordable health insurance options.

The HHS argues that this option remains more important than ever given that insurance premiums have more than doubled under Obamacare and that half of American counties only have one individual insurance carrier to choose from in 2018.

The HHS also found that short-term health insurance options remain more affordable than Obamacare insurance plans. In the fourth quarter of 2016, a short-term health insurance plan cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized Obamacare plan cost $393 per month.

In October, Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) praised Trump’s executive order as “the biggest free-market reform of health care in a generation,” adding that it will allow Americans to purchase health insurance across state lines.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma claimed in a statement on Tuesday, “Americans who find themselves between jobs or simply can’t afford coverage because prices are too high will be helped by President Trump’s Healthcare for All Executive Order.”

Verma added, “In a market that is experiencing double-digit rate increases, allowing short-term, limited-duration insurance to cover longer periods gives Americans options and could be the difference between someone getting coverage or going without coverage at all.”The Trump administration announced a new grant program under the Title X family planning program that has $260 million available to grantees that do not perform abortions.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) says it has been working on ways to streamline the application process for interested organizations. Programs that wish to apply are now able to submit one application that covers multiple geographic service areas.

“We encourage all qualified organizations to apply, especially those proposing innovative strategies that would increase the number of clients served and the quality of services provided,” said Assistant Secretary for Health Brett P. Giroir, M.D. in a press statement. “We are committed to ensuring that we provide access to quality family planning services to the women and men who depend on this vital public health program.”

The Trump administration hopes to assist family planning projects that might include “family planning methods and services, including information, education and counseling related to family planning, preconception care, contraception, natural family planning and infertility services.”

HHS states:

In particular, this year’s funding opportunity is seeking applicants that offer a broad range of family planning and related health services tailored to the individual needs of the client and that promote optimal health outcomes. As emphasized in the statutory language governing the program, “none of the funds appropriated under this title shall be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.”

The new grant program also requires grantees to “develop monitoring and reporting policies” to ensure “victims of child abuse, child molestation, sexual abuse, rape, incest, intimate partner violence or human trafficking” are provided with assistance and legal protection. All staff at grantee programs will be required to receive annual training to respond to these situations.Gay U.S. Olympic skier Gus Kenworthy has a question for you: What “tf” is Ivanka Trump doing at the Winter Olympics?

Early Sunday morning, Kenworthy tweeted out a picture of his fellow Team USA competitors. Kenworthy wrote, “So proud of all these people! Everybody here has worked so hard to make it to the Olympics and have the opportunity to walk in the closing ceremony! Well… Everyone except Ivanka. Honestly, tf is she doing here??”

Ivanka’s presence at the Winter Olympics is pretty easily explained. According to the AP, “The elder daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump is watching the closing ceremony in the same box as South Korean President Moon Jae-In and top North Korean official Kim Yong Chol. She has said the purpose of her visit is to advocate maximum pressure on North Korea to halt its nuclear program.”

Kenworthy’s shot at Ivanka wasn’t his only swipe at the the Trump Administration on Sunday:

Shortly after that, Kenworthy used an X-ray of his broken thumb to point out that, despite breaking his thumb, the silver lining was that the injury would prevent him from shaking Vice President Pence’s hand:

Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinnPresident Trump used a Saturday morning tweet to emphasize his conviction that school shootings will end if we train and arm school teachers and staff.

Trump proposed arming teachers on February 21 and has reiterated the proposal every day since.

On the 21st he suggested arming “20 percent” of public school teachers, and on the 22nd he stressed that first responders are “5 to 8 minutes away,” but teachers can shoot sickos “immediately.”

On the 23rd he spoke at CPAC, and the Daily Mail reported that he also emphasized that we know firsthand the death and mayhem that results when teachers are denied the ability to be armed. He said, “When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones it just puts our students in far more danger.” He explained that it does not have to be that way; that teachers love their students and, because of that love, will defend their students if armed.

On the 24th Trump tweeted:

Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them. Very smart people. Must be firearms adept & have annual training. Should get yearly bonus. Shootings will not happen again – a big & very inexpensive deterrent. Up to States. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2018

No teachers were armed when the February 14 attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School occurred. As a result, Nikolas Cruz had a number of minutes without armed resistance and was able to kill 17 people.

A CNN report claims four Broward County sheriff’s deputies were outside the school while the attack was occurring, but none of the deputies went inside to confront Cruz. Armed teachers could have protected students while deputies were outside doing nothing.

White House officials confirmed to Breitbart News that Trump was running for re-election but referred additional questions to the campaign.

Parscale served as the no-drama digital media director for Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, scoring one of the biggest political upsets in modern history with his digital Facebook-central political strategy.

He turned down a job at the White House in favor of working his digital and advertising consulting, avoiding the early drama of the Trump administration.

“When Donald Trump asked me to work on the campaign I also knew I had a great piece of product that would resonate with Americans,” he said afterward. “You want a great product, you want things that resonate with people and make them dance.”

Trump selection of Parscale demonstrates his commitment to continuing a digital-first campaign in 2020. It also suggests that the president will take a greater role in political and campaign messaging, while Parscale will be in charge of amplifying that message.

“Brad was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run,” Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner said in a statement, promising a “best-in-class campaign.” Kushner is currently the Senior Advisor and Assistant to the President.

“I understood early that Facebook was how Donald Trump was going to win,” Parscale told CBS 60 Minutes in an October 2017 interview. “Twitter is how he talked to the people. Facebook was going to be how he won.”

Parscale has voiced his opinions about digital campaigns and advertising on Twitter, especially disputing the suggestion that the Russians swayed the election for Trump with digital advertising projects.

“He has our family’s complete trust and is the perfect person to be at the helm of the campaign,” Donald Trump’s son Eric Trump said in a statement.

Parscale worked well with the family, adamantly disputing the Michael Wolff depiction of the Trump campaign in the book Fire and Fury.A top U.S. diplomat to North Korea has unexpectedly announced his retirement days after President Donald Trump expressed a willingness to open talks with the rogue communist state.

Joseph Yun, 64, said that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson accepted his resignation “with regret” after 23 years of civil service.

“We are sorry to see him retire, but our diplomatic efforts regarding North Korea will continue based on our maximum pressure campaign to isolate the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) until it agrees to begin credible talks toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.

The Obama administration appointed Yun as the U.S. special representative for North Korean policy in October 2016, and he played an important role in the release of the imprisoned college student Otto Warmbier, who died shortly after his return home.

His retirement comes at a precarious time following a relatively successful Winter Olympics in South Korea in which both countries engaged in joint efforts, such as marching under one flag and fielding a joint ice hockey team.

Many were surprised by his sudden departure, given that Yun recently visited South Korea and Japan to discuss solutions to the North Korea crisis as the regime continues to develop its nuclear program and threaten war against America.

In Tokyo, Yun said the U.S. was still a distance away from using a military option against the Kim regime and, instead, would pursue diplomatic means of de-escalating the situation.

“Our policy is based on putting pressure as well as leaving the door open for a dialogue,” he said. “I think everyone wants to give diplomacy a good run.”

Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced the toughest sanctions ever put in place against North Korea, which involve the targeting of shipping and vessels that allow the regime to sustain itself economically.

President Donald Trump has since mulled the possibility of opening talks with the North Korean regime but “only under the right conditions.”

“I think this is a huge loss for the U.S. government at a critical moment,” Abraham Denmark, the director of the Asia Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, told CNN.

“He was a great advocate for dialogue and for diplomacy, and I think it’s unfortunate that his voice will no longer be in the conversation inside the U.S. government,” he added.

Trump — his cornerstone promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border. So when will these Trump-faithful see this promise realized?

Talk and chants of “build the wall” at Trump’s 100 Days rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, revealed no waning in Trump supporters’ eager anticipation of seeing one built along the U.S. southern border. Building the wall was a cornerstone promise of Trump’s historic 2016 presidential campaign.

Just five days into his term as president, Donald Trump took action on his promise of a wall and border security and issued his executive order on Border Security and Immigration Enforcement Improvements. The order established executive branch policy to “secure the southern border of the United States through the immediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border, monitored and supported by adequate personnel so as to prevent illegal immigration, drug and human trafficking, and acts of terrorism.”

Additional policies established in the order included detention of individuals suspected to have violated federal law, expedite claims of eligibility to remain in the U.S., remove those whose claims have been rejected, and cooperation with state and local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration priorities.

In the order, the Secretary of Homeland Security was ordered to, “take all appropriate steps to immediately plan, design, and construct a physical wall along the southern border, using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border.” The secretary was also tasked with identifying and allocating the funds to build the wall. It is the secretary’s job to prepare “Congressional budget requests for the current and upcoming fiscal years.”

The current secretary of Homeland Security is Kirstjen Nielsen. She succeeded John Kelly when he left the position after six months to become White House Chief of Staff.

In March, CBP stated that it wasn’t sure how much it would cost to build the wall. A budget request was put in for $2.6 billion to go toward implementation of President Trump’s executive order, including not only the border wall but money for technology and hiring.

May brought the conclusion of President Trump’s first 100 days and uncertainty from the White House and Congress as to when Trump supporters looking for the campaign-promise along the southern border would see it built.

In October, eight border wall prototypes were completed next to the border in San Diego. On October 26, the prototypes were unveiled to members of the media. Four were composed of concrete and four others consisted of other materials. Each represented an individual contractor chosen through a bidding process, each one was to produce a prototype. The concrete had to set for 30 days before CBP could begin testing the walls.

Time-lapse video of the construction process can be seen here:

Testing on the prototypes began in late November and early December. Testers included members of BORTAC (Border Patrol Tactical Unit). The San Diego Union-Tribune reported on the testing activities including attempts to scale the walls with wires and grappling hooks. Newsweek reported that testing also included battering the walls with saws, jackhammers, and other tools. Southwest Border Branch Chief Carlos Diaz told the outlet, “CBP is testing the prototypes against the techniques used by smugglers on the southwest border to circumvent current border barrier.”

A CBP official told Breitbart News that the actual wall built may not replicate any one of the eight prototypes. Testing may lead to variations on the final form of the wall. According to officials, a new bidding process will determine what contractor(s) will be chosen to build that final version of the wall. The contractor may or may not be one of those chosen to build the prototypes.

CBP Acting Deputy Commissioner Ron Vitiello took questions during the October 26 unveiling during which he responded to the question: if they had the funding to construct the wall today, when would it be completed. He said that he was not sure when completion would be. Vitiello emphasized that border walls are an “extremely effective part” of the “multi-pronged security strategy to prevent the illegal migration of people and drugs, over many years.”

Vitiello identified congressional appropriations to fund the wall as the “limiting factor” in constructing the wall. He said that CBP has provided Congress “with as much information as we have now as it relates to estimates, locations, and priorities” in order to make the necessary appropriations.

In late November, the Senate homeland defense budget committee approved just shy of $1.6 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2018 funding to build a small amount of border wall. The House of Representatives had already approved the funding amount.

House Speaker Paul Ryan’s plans last October to pass DACA amnesty have not required funding to complete the border wall according to his fellow Republicans.

In September, legislative director Marc Short indicated that “a barrier” was important to border security but told The Hill that DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and wall funding need not be part of the same deal, “I don’t want to bind us into a construct that would make the conclusion on DACA impossible.” Within days of Short’s comments, Trump told reporters that he was willing to make a deal on DACA separate from wall funding.

During a December 20 cabinet meeting, President Trump called on Congress to fund the border wall, “which we’re getting very close to.” He spoke of the border wall prototypes constructed in San Diego and revealed, “I may be going there, very shortly, to look at them in their final form.”

Then in the last week of 2017, President Trump gave Democrats an ultimatum on border wall funding, “no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.” The wall funding requirement is one Trump has been declaring for months.

As of the last days of 2017, Congress had not passed legislation to fully fund the president’s promised wall along the U.S. southern border.

Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana.WASHINGTON, DC – The Judicial Crisis Network (JCN) has launched a six-figure ad campaign thanking President Donald Trump and Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for their historic achievements on appointing federal judges during the first year of the Trump presidency.

President Trump has already made history regarding judicial appointments, setting an all-time first-year record of confirming twelve federal appeals court judges in 2017. He has declared that his impact on the judiciary will likely be one of the most enduring parts of his legacy, noting that some of the judges he is appointing could still be on the bench three decades after his presidency.

Article II of the Constitution specifies that all federal judges at all three levels of the federal judiciary — the Supreme Court, circuit courts of appeals, and districts courts where trials are conducted — are nominated by the president and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Once confirmed, they hold their offices for life.

JCN is the foremost advocacy organization in the United States exclusively dedicated to confirming judicial conservatives — originalists and textualists — to the federal bench. No organization has done more in the movement-wide strategy for conservatives in maximizing the number of conservative judges on the bench.

The first ad in the $350,000 week-long campaign focuses on the president.

The words “Trump is rapidly reshaping the judiciary,” flash across the screen, quoting the headline of a November New York Times article. “Since our nation’s founding, no one has gotten circuit court judges confirmed faster,” says a narrator.

The second ad praises McConnell’s work on judges as Senate majority leader. McConnell has kept his caucus together to end judicial filibusters and dedicated the enormous number of hours of Senate floor debate necessary to push past the unprecedented delaying tactics Senate Democrats have employed in failed attempts to block President Trump’s nominees.

“Senator McConnell, he’s kept his promises, leading the Senate to confirm a record number of circuit court judges,” declares the ad. “Brilliant judges who will apply the Constitution just as it is written, and serve on our courts for decades to come.”

“President Trump is keeping his campaign promise to fill the federal bench with brilliant judges who will follow the Constitution,” said JCN Chief Counsel Carrie Severino, “and thanks to the strong leadership of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell they are being confirmed by the Senate.”

A third ad will debut later in the week, praising Grassley’s work as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman. Grassley ended abuse of the blue-slip courtesy that Senate Democrats attempted to turn into a one-senator veto of nominees that enjoyed support from a majority of senators.

Prior to President Trump’s election, McConnell and Grassley pulled off what most pundits had considered impossible, preventing President Barack Obama from filling the Supreme Court seat left open by the unexpected February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia.

President Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to that seat in January 2017. McConnell and Grassley successfully navigated Gorsuch through the Senate to his confirmation to the High Court in April 2017.

This while the Clinton Foundation “left [Haiti] in a s-hole,” Diamond claimed, using a radio- friendly term instead of saying the word “s**thole.” Referring to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Diamond exclaimed: “They were supposed to build them homes; they left them in huts. Remember that?”

The duo also criticized the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton for destabilizing the North African nation of Libya.

Here is a transcript of their remarks concerning Trump’s alleged “sh*thole” comments:

How do we know that this is true? We don’t know if this is true but you have the media take what Dick Durbin said as to be factual and spread it as if it was true and create a distraction. When it comes to these countries like Haiti and Africa. First thing, with Haiti. Now they want to say something about what somebody said. Somebody may have called it an s-hole. Whatever, whatever, whatever. Well, what about the Clinton Foundation? When they left them in a s-hole. They were supposed to build them homes; they left them in huts. Remember that? And let’s look at the continent of Africa. The country Libya that is inside of Africa. That country was destabilized by the Obama Administration and by Hillary Clinton. Left those people desolate. Not only that. Black men are now being sold into slavery but the media don’t mention anything about that. You want to take a s-hole comment that you think… here you are going on hearsay. As if Casper the friendly ghost may have spoken. Hearsay. You are going on that and you want to spread that as factual just to make our president look bad?

The Clinton Foundation reportedly raised some $30 million for projects in Haiti. “Every penny of the more than $30m raised was deployed on the ground, with no overhead taken by the Clinton Foundation,” a foundation spokesperson told the BBC.

The BBC reported that in 2012 the Clinton Foundation worked with the U.S. State Department under Hillary Clinton to arrange a U.S.-subsidized $300 million project to build a factory complex in Haiti.

The news agency further reported:

Several hundred farmers were evicted from their land to make way for the 600-acre manufacturing site, which produces clothes for retailers such as Old Navy, Walmart and Target. South Korean textile giant Sae-A Trading Co, which is the main employer at the facility, subsequently donated between $50,000 to $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation. Mr Clinton declared 100,000 jobs would be created “in short order”. But the Caracol Industrial Park has created only 8,000 jobs.

Trump has denied using the word “s**thole” to describe African countries during a meeting earlier this month with a group of six senators to discuss immigration reform.

Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL), the only Democrat at the meeting in question, claimed that Trump’s remarks were reported accurately.

Sen. David Perdue (R-GA), who was present, said the “s**thole” reports were a “gross misrepresentation” of what Trump had actually said.

“I am telling you that he did not use that word. And I’m telling you it’s a gross misrepresentation,” Perdue said on ABC’s This Week.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AK), who was also present, went on CBS’s “Face the Nation” to say he “didn’t hear” the curse word used “and I was sitting no further away from Donald Trump than Dick Durbin was.”

“Trump won’t read anything. He gets up halfway through meetings with World leaders because he is bored,” Legend read during the surprise comedy bit meant to introduce the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.

“His comb-over: A product called ‘Just for Men,'” Cher said.

“Trump did not enjoy his own inauguration, he started to get angry and hurt that stars were there to hurt him and embarrass him,” Snoop Dogg said.

Cardi B and DJ Khaled read passages about President Trump’s purported love of McDonald’s cheeseburgers.

The skit ended, however, with Clinton, who garnered thunderous applause from the star-studded audience at Madison Square Garden.

“One reason why he liked to eat at McDonald’s: Nobody knew he was coming and the food was safely premade,” Clinton read, later asking Corden if she had the spoken word award “in the bag.”

Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudsonAccording to a New York Daily News report dated November 20, 1991, when he spotted a “big guy with a big bat” beating on another guy, Donald Trump told his limousine driver to pull over. Witnesses told the paper, that “with [then-girlfriend] Marla Maples tugging at his arm to try to stop him, [Trump] leaped from his black stretch limousine Monday evening during the Manhattan assault.”

The Manhattan billionaire, who was 45 at the time, told the story from there. “The guy with the bat looked at me, and I said, “Look, you’ve gotta stop this. Put down the bat. I guess he recognized me because he said, ‘Mr. Trump, I didn’t do anything wrong.’ I said, ‘How could you not do anything wrong when you’re whacking a guy with a bat?’ Then he ran away.”

Trump added that he saw the mugger deliver “five or six good whacks” before he put a stop to it.

Witness accounts varied. One young woman says Trump only got out of his limo only to see what was going on after it had already happened and the mugger was long gone.

Another witness, though, backed The Donald’s account. “All of a sudden, a big long limousine pulls up on an angle, and Donald Trump pops out with the blond, too,” the unnamed witness said. “There was a guy with a bat, hitting a guy over the head, and Trump yelled, ‘Put that bat down. What are you doing?’ The guy dropped the bat, came over and started talking to him.”

Trump, who was on his way to a Paula Abdul concert, said that he only left the scene when he knew an ambulance was on the way and saw that the victim was being treated by a witness who appeared to be a doctor.

At the time, there was no police report filed about the attack.

The reporter, James Rosen, does not disclose how he learned of the incident. Trump said he was surprised anyone heard about it. “I’m not looking to play this thing up,” Trump told Rosen. “I’m surprised you found out about it.”

Rosen also reports that “Trump was at first reluctant to discuss his daredevil deed, but then he warmed to the task.”

Trump’s famous ability to manipulate the New York press should always be kept in mind.

New York in the pre-Giuliani days of 1991 was not the New York of today, the New York that looks like a Hollywood backlot dressed for a romcom. No, in 1991, New York looked like this and the statistics looked like this. Just a few weeks earlier, in fact, Trump’s own mother had been mugged before a bystander named Lawrence Herbert chased the thug away.

A full 27 years later, this story surfaced online after the media roundly mocked President Trump over his claim that, unlike the local deputies at the scene, he would not have stood outside as innocent children were being massacred at a school in Parkland, Florida.

CNN’s anti-Trump pundit, Jake Tapper, who is himself using traumatized children as human shields to hide from the widespread criticism of his mishandling of last week’s anti-gun town hall, angrily lashed out at Trump over the school shooting comments. Tapper has yet to comment on this 1991 report.

In its own snarky attack on Trump, the far-left Washington Post also failed to inform its readers about this report of Trump stopping a mugging.

The news was first reported by the New York Times.

After helping usher massive tax cuts across the finish line, Cohn signaled interest in remaining at the White House — and even spoke to the president about possibly replacing Gen. John Kelly as chief of staff, according to the report.

Instead, he is leaving in the face of Trump’s tough actions on trade.

“Gary has been my chief economic adviser and did a superb job in driving our agenda, helping to deliver historic tax cuts and reforms and unleashing the American economy once again,” Trump said in a statement. “He is a rare talent, and I thank him for his dedicated service to the American people.”

Cohn was an early hire for Trump’s administration, as the president wanted a “killer” in his administration who was good at closing deals. Although a Democrat, Cohn chose to the join the administration to advise the president on fostering good policy for business and the economy.

“I am grateful to the President for giving me this opportunity and wish him and the Administration great success in the future,” Cohn said in a statement.

Although Cohn threatened to resign in the wake of Trump’s controversial comments about protestors in Charlottesville, Virginia, he remained in the White House to help push forward tax reform

Cohn again threatened to resign after Trump announced his proposed tariffs on aluminum and steel on Thursday, but it appears the president was not concerned.

“People will always come and go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision,” he wrote on Twitter Tuesday morning. “I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection).”

The news of Cohn’s resignation broke right after Trump told reporters that he was ready for some staffers to leave the White House, but that it was an exciting place to work with many coveted positions.

“Believe me, everybody wants to work in the White House,” he said at a press conference. “They all want a piece of the Oval Office, they want a piece of the West Wing.”Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s seemingly sudden dismissal by President Donald Trump comes after a year of constant stories about his impending departure.

He had a number of significant policy and messaging disputes with the president, and every one of them was followed by a chorus of unnamed administration sources telling reporters that Tillerson’s ouster was imminent.

Here are some of the most significant and highly publicized disagreements between President Trump and his first secretary of state:

Russia. Trump critics immediately assumed Tillerson was fired for speaking out of turn by blaming Russia for the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. However, senior administration officials claim Tillerson was asked to step down on Friday, three days before he made his comments about Russia. A source close to Pompeo told CNN he has known he would transition from CIA director to secretary of state since December, and his successor Gina Haspel has been effectively running the CIA for months while he prepared himself for the move.

Ironically, Tillerson’s history of business dealings with Russia fueled early criticism that his appointment as Secretary of State was a sign that Trump would be very soft on Moscow. By the time of his departure, Tillerson was seen as tougher than Trump on Russia, and the president was criticized for failing to follow his lead. For his part, Vladimir Putin said he regretted awarding Tillerson the “Order of Friendship” in 2013.

Tillerson took a more outspokenly negative view of Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Syria than Trump, and pointedly disagreed with him about Russia’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 election. As recently as November, some analysts said Tillerson had grown so confident of his position, so certain that he would not be fired, that he was making his own foreign policy and using his public comments to prod Trump into seeing things his way.

Tillerson reportedly told an associate in July that he was “stunned” by President Trump’s apparent willingness to accept Putin’s denial of Russian meddling in the 2016 election.

The “moron” incident. It would also be remiss not to mention the July 2017 Pentagon meeting at which Tillerson allegedly referred to President Trump as a “moron.”

Reports at the time claimed Tillerson spent the entire summer on the verge of quitting and was prevented from leaving only by appeals from Vice President Mike Pence.

Speculation about the exact reason for Tillerson’s outburst ran wild throughout Washington. Early rumors held that Tillerson, a former president of the Boy Scouts, was angered by Trump’s “politicized speech” to the organization. Some said Tillerson disliked Trump’s policy on Afghanistan. Later a theory developed that Tillerson thought Trump was a “moron” because he wanted to increase America’s inventory of nuclear weapons.

The State Department denied Tillerson used “that type of language” to refer to President Trump. Tillerson said at the time, and repeated as recently as a February interview with CBS News’ 60 Minutes, that he would not dignify questions about the “moron” incident with a response. Administration critics took this as a tacit admission that he did insult the president. Tillerson responded that focusing on rumors about what language he used in the Pentagon meeting was one of the “destructive games” of Washington.

North Korea. The stated reason for Tillerson’s replacement as Secretary of State is North Korea policy. Trump famously told Tillerson in October that he was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.” This was taken at the time as the clearest signal to date that Trump was not happy with his Secretary of State, and that Tillerson was conducting his own rogue foreign policy, although Trump and Tillerson downplayed it as a bit of good-natured ribbing.

Tillerson was therefore either surprised or gratified, depending on which source talks to a particular reporter, when Trump announced he was willing to meet with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. Just hours before the announcement was made, Tillerson told reporters, “We’re a long way from negotiations. We just need to be very clear-eyed and realistic about it.”

Some media soothsayers took it as a grim omen for Tillerson’s career that he was so clearly out of the loop when the most potentially important U.S. diplomatic mission in a generation was launched. Trump confirmed on Tuesday that he made his decision to meet with Kim Jong-un without consulting Tillerson.

Afghanistan. Tillerson was seen as undercutting Trump’s strategy in Afghanistan in August. Shortly after Trump declared “our troops will fight to win” and “from now on, victory will have a clear definition,” Tillerson told the Taliban: “You will not win a battlefield victory. We may not win one, but neither will you.”

“We believe that we can turn the tide of what has been a losing battle over the last year and a half or so and at least stabilize the situation and, hopefully, start seeing some battlefield victories on the part of the Afghan forces,” Tillerson said, in what was taken as a significant break from Trump’s promise of fighting to win and settling for nothing less than the defeat of the Taliban.

Supporters of the Trump administration’s diplomatic strategy pointed to the Afghanistan dispute as an example of the “good cop, bad cop” routine. Detractors sensed a power struggle between Trump loyalists and a dissident faction headed by Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who happens to have been in Afghanistan when Trump announced Tillerson’s departure on Tuesday.

Qatar. One of the most carefully scrutinized differences of opinion between President Trump and Secretary of State Tillerson involved Qatar. Trump was outspokenly supportive of the decision by Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain to take action against Qatar for supporting terrorism. Tillerson’s criticism of Qatar was moderated by encouraging all parties to refrain from escalating the situation, and praise for Qatari progress in “halting financial support and expelling terrorist elements.”

“Everybody was taken by surprise by the president’s comments. It undermined what the secretary had to say. The policy that is being worked is the Tillerson policy, Trump’s comments notwithstanding,” a State Department official told the Washington Post in June.

In July, Trump praised Tillerson for “doing a terrific job” and said they disagreed “only in terms of tone” on Qatar. However, Tillerson continued to be much more critical of the “quartet” blockading Qatar than President Trump.

“There seems to be a real unwillingness on the part of some of the parties to want to engage. It’s up to the leadership of the quartet when they want to engage with Qatar because Qatar has been very clear—they’re ready to engage,” Tillerson said in October as he was preparing for another trip to the region.

In January, after the administration resolved a dispute with Qatar over airline subsidies, Tillerson praised Qatar as a “strong partner and a longtime friend of the United States.” He also talked up enhanced trade and energy cooperation between the U.S. and Qatar, and once again praised the Qataris for the improvements they have made in counterterrorism. Meanwhile, he encouraged Saudi Arabia to be “a bit more measured and a bit more thoughtful” in its actions with respect to Qatar and other Middle Eastern crises.

Some took President Trump’s greater willingness to criticize Saudi Arabia in the new year as a sign he was coming around to Tillerson’s point of view. Trump also thanked the Qataris for “action to counter terrorism and extremism in all forms” in January, a statement taken as a sign that relations between the White House and Qatar could be thawing out.

Iran nuclear deal. Tillerson frankly admitted in August that he disagrees with President Trump about the Iran nuclear deal. Trump has harshly criticized the deal and expressed a strong preference for scuttling or renegotiating it, while Tillerson argued, “There are a lot of alternative means with which we use the agreement to advance our policies and the relationship with Iran.”

After he fired Tillerson, Trump cited the Iran deal as one of the issues he was never able to resolve with the former secretary of state.

“When you look at the Iran deal: I think it’s terrible, I guess he thinks it was OK. I wanted to break it or do something and he felt a little bit differently. So we were not thinking the same,” he said, adding that new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has a more “similar thought process” on the matter.

The Paris climate accord. Tillerson was equally frank in disagreeing with President Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord in June 2017. In fact, he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he was one of the most vocal opponents of Trump’s decision within the administration.

Tillerson gave Trump credit for hearing his views and considering input from European allies before withdrawing from the accord, but was notably absent from the White House ceremony to announce the decision and subsequent public events.

By September, Tillerson was telling reporters that Trump was willing to consider re-entering the Paris climate accords if the “right conditions” could be found. Other administration officials contradicted his remarks and said Trump is willing to work productively with other nations on environmental issues, but will not return to the Paris accords.

In January, Trump said the U.S. “could conceivably go back in” if the Paris agreement, which he described as a “bad deal,” could be altered so that it does not damage the American energy industry. Rumors continue to swirl that Trump is talking to foreign leaders and looking for a way to return to the Paris accords with a renegotiated American position, despite his continuing public criticism of the deal.

Trade and border security. Somewhat surprisingly given his background as a corporate CEO and advocate of free trade—arguably the strongest in the administration next to Gary Cohn, who departed less than a week ago—Tillerson has not publicly clashed with Trump much over trade policy.

One reason for this might be Trump and Tillerson’s shared concern for the danger posed by China’s growing influence. Tillerson has warned developing countries against doing business with China on several occasions, most recently in early February.

However, Tillerson made a trip to Latin America in February that was seen as out-of-step with Trump policies in several respects, including Tillerson’s praise for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which Trump has called “the worst trade deal ever.”

Tillerson was also taken as softer on border security and immigration reform than the president. Tillerson also directly contradicted the president on drug trafficking, praising Mexico for its efforts to interdict drug smuggling within hours of Trump criticizing them for “pouring” drugs into the United States. An official traveling with Tillerson said Trump’s comments were “not helpful” to the secretary of state’s diplomacy.

Israel and the Palestinians. Another muted dispute between Trump and Tillerson concerns the Palestinians. Tillerson was notably cooler than Trump on the notion of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, projecting a considerably longer timetable for the move than other administration officials.

The first State Department report on terrorism under Tillerson was also taken as a sign of distance between State and the White House, with the former much more sympathetic to Palestinian arguments than the latter. In June 2017, Tillerson found it necessary to walk back his confident prediction that the Palestinians would end the horrific practice of paying off the families of terrorists, issuing a revised statement more in line with President Trump’s views.

Tillerson also disagreed with Trump’s position on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Trump and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley conditioned UNRWA aid on the Palestinians returning to peace negotiations, while Tillerson argued the UNRWA is a U.N. agency whose funding should not be linked to Palestinian conduct. The administration ultimately decided not to cut funding for Palestinian refugees, a decision seen as Tillerson prevailing over Haley in persuading Trump.President Donald Trump defended the $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on Sunday, arguing that it was a “downpayment” on his promised wall on the southern border.

“Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall,” Trump said on Twitter. “It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come.”

Trump was referring to the $1,571,000,000 in the bill for new and replacement border fencing. In a second message on Twitter, Trump suggested it would be possible to secure the border with money earmarked for military spending.

“Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense,” he wrote. “Build WALL through M.”

Trump also reminded DACA recipients that he would not abandon them, accusing the Democrats of refusing to make a deal.

“[R]emember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)!” he wrote.

Much can be done with the $1.6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall. It is just a down payment. Work will start immediately. The rest of the money will come – and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2018The left and media are presenting a decision by elements of the Trump administration to not pursue an immediate stay in court as a win by LGBTQ forces seeking to force President Donald Trump, America’s Commander-in-Chief, to accept transgender recruits into the U.S. military.

But it might not be as big a win as they would have hoped for, as conservative forces rally behind the president with a variety of plans to crush the short-term leftist victory—though it does remain to be seen if the administration’s various departments responsible, primarily Justice and Defense, will follow through on efforts to get Trump another win.

As of Jan. 2, thanks to lower court rulings blocking implementation of President Trump’s directive to the Department of Defense, transgender individuals can legally enlist in the U.S. military. That is in direct contravention of an order the Commander-in-Chief handed down to Defense Secretary James Mattis back in August, one that has been challenged in court and blocked by a district judge by a preliminary injunction while the case is ongoing. On appeal, two U.S. courts of appeals—the Fourth Circuit and the D.C. Circuit—upheld two lower courts’ preliminary injunctions, blocking Trump’s transgender ban on military enlistment.

Perhaps most importantly, it sets up a potential constitutional crisis, George Rasley of Richard Viguerie’s ConservativeHQ told Breitbart News.

“The judge’s order directing President Trump to enlist transgenders into the military is a constitutional crisis of the first order,” Rasley said in an email. “From usurping the administration’s immigration powers to the powers of the commander in chief, federal judges have attempted coup after coup against Donald Trump. If the President and his lawyers do not fight back more aggressively there will be no presidential power that these left wing judges will not attempt the seize for themselves.”

Shocking many conservatives and Trump supporters, the Department of Justice—and Department of Defense—did not seek a stay from the U.S. Supreme Court, which will likely eventually hear the case, and perhaps grant a stay nullifying the lower court’s block while the legal process plays itself out. That decision appears to be a questionable one, and many conservatives and Trump supporters are baffled at why the Trump administration’s DOJ would not step forward and press this issue right this second.

Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness said in a lengthy statement issued Tuesday:

Under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the federal courts have no authority to make policy regarding the military. The Department of Justice (DoJ) should have protected the constitutional rights of President Donald J. Trump by filing an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court immediately after the District of Columbia and Fourth Circuit Courts of Appeals denied requests for stays of lower court preliminary injunctions. The issue is not the military transgender policy alone, but who gets to decide what the policy will be. By failing to petition the Supreme Court to stay the lower court orders, the DoJ has tacitly conceded that federal judges can make military policy and establish medical standards for enlistments. According to Reuters, a Justice Department official who requested anonymity noted that the Defense Department has set up a ‘study’ to review the issue. Rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for the DoD’s study and continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime. This is a lame excuse, making as much sense as the 2016 Trump Campaign allowing the Federal Election Commission to declare Hillary Clinton the winner of the presidential race early on Election Night, relying on vote counts coming in later to undo that result. The DoJ’s reported strategy might be plausible IF the Defense Department ‘study’ in question were truly fact-based and objective, and IF the DoD had taken steps to provide conditional enlistment contracts with transgender personnel who are recruited under the force of federal court orders. Neither expectation has been met.

Chris Hull, an executive vice president of the Center for Security Policy who previously served as chief of staff to Rep. Steve King (R-IA), is similarly upset.

“These individuals suffer from a serious mental illness with suicide rates of up to 40%, which is eight times as high as the rate among schizophrenics, who are barred from military service,” Hull told Breitbart News. “We already have a problem with suicide in the military without actively recruiting those among the most likely to die at their own hands.”

But, per the Department of Justice, they are following the instructions of the Department of Defense and the White House. The Pentagon is, per the DOJ, working on a new study on the matter—and things are on hold until then and until the next stages of litigation.

“The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks,” DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told Breitbart News. “So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the President’s and Secretary of Defense’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime.”

In other words: DOJ lawyers are just like the lawyers for their clients, trying to formulate a legal strategy that they think will win their clients’ case. But, by no means has the DOJ abandoned the case—and it is still fighting to defend the legality of the president’s directive.

Sources close to the matter and with direct knowledge tell Breitbart News that the issue came up at a National Security Council principals meeting on Tuesday—and the senior-most officials in the Trump administration are seeking a pathway forward to dealing with this matter. Sources close to the process have told Breitbart News that there may be a better option on the table for the president if he wants to succeed here, and it involves a strategy laid out for him by several top conservative leaders.

A letter sent to President Trump signed by various military and law enforcement conservative leaders, including President Ronald Reagan’s Attorney General Ed Meese, lays out a new pathway forward for President Trump to block transgender individuals from serving in the military.

Meese and the other conservative leaders wrote to President Trump before the New Year:

As you know, several district judges have recently ordered the Department of Defense to begin enlisting individuals who identify as transgender into the military on January 2, 2018. These orders are not only at odds with your directive of August 25, 2017 to the Secretary of Defense and, with respect to the Coast Guard, to the Secretary of Homeland Security precluding such a change in policy. It is also a judicial intrusion upon your exclusive authority as Commander-in-Chief pursuant to Article II of the Constitution and a dangerous affront to your responsibility to determine the make-up and disposition of the nation’s armed forces. Unfortunately, this is not the only example of unacceptable infringements on your presidential powers. Courts have been eager to strike down your immigration-related executive orders with politically-motivated rulings. Moreover, as Bloomberg reported yesterday in a news report headlined, ‘Washington Bureaucrats Are Quietly Working to Undermine Trump’s Agenda,’ others in the government have been emboldened to subvert your administration and policies. We believe strongly that your decision to prevent additional enlistments of individuals who identify as transgender in the U.S. armed forces is fully justified in light of the grave harm such a policy change would portend for the readiness, morale, unit cohesion and funding challenges facing our military. In addition, it would be a most dangerous precedent to have the judiciary interjecting itself into your exclusive, constitutional command authority and responsibility to create a right to serve where there is none – let alone extending that right to people whose medical condition and requirements are, as a practical matter, incompatible with military service and a burden on an already stressed military budget.

They continued in the letter to President Trump by noting that there is a different pathway forward for him that would take the power away from activist judges attempting to nullify his presidency, and allow him to move forward with implementation of his ban on transgender individuals enlisting in the U.S. military. The conservative leaders wrote to President Trump:

To allow this court order to stand, moreover, would be to invite the judiciary to trespass further on your executive authority and the chain of command. Predictably, it would also empower government employees to ignore presidential direction – with profound and adverse implications for the Republic. In the interest of avoiding such intolerable consequences and preventing avoidable harm from being inflicted on the armed forces with the initiation of enlistments of individuals who identify as transgender, we recommend that you immediately issue a new directive to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security along the lines of the attached. It simply preserves your authority and responsibility to establish accession standards for military service, pending the outcome of ongoing litigation.

In addition to Meese, the other signers of the letter include retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney, Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, Retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Lyons, and Elaine Donnelly from the Center for Military Readiness.

Taking this new action would supersede the old executive action. The draft text, also obtained by Breitbart News, would allow transgender individuals to serve in the military only during the timeframe in which this court case will make its way through the court system—from the district court level all the way up through the appeals court to the Supreme Court if necessary. Their enlistment contracts would include specific provisions that they may not avail themselves of sex-change surgeries or other expensive medical options at taxpayer expense during this time, and that they will immediately be discharged from the military if and when the administration prevails in court. Doing it this way, as well, allows time for the Department of Justice to build its case out with evidence at the district court level—evidence that will eventually be considered in the very likely event that the U.S. Supreme Court eventually considers this case.

This order will likely be challenged as well. But by resetting the clock this way, a Supreme Court decision on the president’s policy would likely not come down before 2019, when it is very possible that the court will have one or two more conservative Justices in place of the potentially retiring Anthony Kennedy and the aging Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

In other words, Trump could sign a new order immediately with language close to what Meese and company are suggesting very soon. Then, the same judges at both the district court and appeals courts levels that blocked Trump’s directive from implementation would predictably block this one. The new order would replace the old one—and this new one would become the focus of the court case.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the Justice Department official responsible for preparing the DOJ’s legal strategy here, would then ask the Supreme Court for a stay on the lower court order blocking implementation—and by the time those actions have passed, no transgender individuals or at least very few would have gotten into the military and the case would not be on the Supreme Court docket until 2019 rather than this year, in 2018.

Again, it all remains to be seen what President Trump, the DOJ, and the Department of Defense do here in the end. The DOJ and White House have not responded to specific requests for comment about this letter and plan. But the fact that Meese, a former U.S. Attorney General for President Reagan, is signed onto this letter lends significant credibility to the idea that President Trump—who sources say has read their letter and is considering their ideas—may move forward with such a strategy.The left and media are presenting a decision by elements of the Trump administration to not pursue an immediate stay in court as a win by LGBTQ forces seeking to force President Donald Trump, America’s Commander-in-Chief, to accept transgender recruits into the U.S. military.

Under Article III of the U.S. Constitution, the federal courts have no authority to make policy regarding the military. The Department of Justice (DoJ) should have protected the constitutional rights of President Donald J. Trump by filing an emergency appeal with the Supreme Court immediately after the District of Columbia and Fourth Circuit Courts of Appeals denied requests for stays of lower court preliminary injunctions. The issue is not the military transgender policy alone, but who gets to decide what the policy will be. By failing to petition the Supreme Court to stay the lower court orders, the DoJ has tacitly conceded that federal judges can make military policy and establish medical standards for enlistments. According to Reuters, a Justice Department official who requested anonymity noted that the Defense Department has set up a ‘study’ to review the issue. Rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for the DoD’s study and continue to defend the president’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime. This is a lame excuse, making as much sense as the 2016 Trump Campaign allowing the Federal Election Commission to declare Hillary Clinton the winner of the presidential race early on Election Night, relying on vote counts coming in later to undo that result. The DoJ’s reported strategy might be plausible IF the Defense Department ‘study’ in question were truly fact-based and objective, and IF the DoD had taken steps to provide conditional enlistment contracts with transgender personnel who are recruited under the force of federal court orders. Neither expectation has been met.

Chris Hull, an executive vice president of the Center for Security Policy who previously served as chief of staff to Rep. Steve King (R-IA), is similarly upset.

“These individuals suffer from a serious mental illness with suicide rates of up to 40%, which is eight times as high as the rate among schizophrenics, who are barred from military service,” Hull told Breitbart News. “We already have a problem with suicide in the military without actively recruiting those among the most likely to die at their own hands.”

But, per the Department of Justice, they are following the instructions of the Department of Defense and the White House. The Pentagon is, per the DOJ, working on a new study on the matter—and things are on hold until then and until the next stages of litigation.

“The Department of Defense has announced that it will be releasing an independent study of these issues in the coming weeks,” DOJ spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores told Breitbart News. “So rather than litigate this interim appeal before that occurs, the administration has decided to wait for DOD’s study and will continue to defend the President’s and Secretary of Defense’s lawful authority in district court in the meantime.”

In other words: DOJ lawyers are just like the lawyers for their clients, trying to formulate a legal strategy that they think will win their clients’ case. But, by no means has the DOJ abandoned the case—and it is still fighting to defend the legality of the president’s directive.

Sources close to the matter and with direct knowledge tell Breitbart News that the issue came up at a National Security Council principals meeting on Tuesday—and the senior-most officials in the Trump administration are seeking a pathway forward to dealing with this matter. Sources close to the process have told Breitbart News that there may be a better option on the table for the president if he wants to succeed here, and it involves a strategy laid out for him by several top conservative leaders.

A letter sent to President Trump signed by various military and law enforcement conservative leaders, including President Ronald Reagan’s Attorney General Ed Meese, lays out a new pathway forward for President Trump to block transgender individuals from serving in the military.

Meese and the other conservative leaders wrote to President Trump before the New Year:

As you know, several district judges have recently ordered the Department of Defense to begin enlisting individuals who identify as transgender into the military on January 2, 2018. These orders are not only at odds with your directive of August 25, 2017 to the Secretary of Defense and, with respect to the Coast Guard, to the Secretary of Homeland Security precluding such a change in policy. It is also a judicial intrusion upon your exclusive authority as Commander-in-Chief pursuant to Article II of the Constitution and a dangerous affront to your responsibility to determine the make-up and disposition of the nation’s armed forces. Unfortunately, this is not the only example of unacceptable infringements on your presidential powers. Courts have been eager to strike down your immigration-related executive orders with politically-motivated rulings. Moreover, as Bloomberg reported yesterday in a news report headlined, ‘Washington Bureaucrats Are Quietly Working to Undermine Trump’s Agenda,’ others in the government have been emboldened to subvert your administration and policies. We believe strongly that your decision to prevent additional enlistments of individuals who identify as transgender in the U.S. armed forces is fully justified in light of the grave harm such a policy change would portend for the readiness, morale, unit cohesion and funding challenges facing our military. In addition, it would be a most dangerous precedent to have the judiciary interjecting itself into your exclusive, constitutional command authority and responsibility to create a right to serve where there is none – let alone extending that right to people whose medical condition and requirements are, as a practical matter, incompatible with military service and a burden on an already stressed military budget.

They continued in the letter to President Trump by noting that there is a different pathway forward for him that would take the power away from activist judges attempting to nullify his presidency, and allow him to move forward with implementation of his ban on transgender individuals enlisting in the U.S. military. The conservative leaders wrote to President Trump:

To allow this court order to stand, moreover, would be to invite the judiciary to trespass further on your executive authority and the chain of command. Predictably, it would also empower government employees to ignore presidential direction – with profound and adverse implications for the Republic. In the interest of avoiding such intolerable consequences and preventing avoidable harm from being inflicted on the armed forces with the initiation of enlistments of individuals who identify as transgender, we recommend that you immediately issue a new directive to the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security along the lines of the attached. It simply preserves your authority and responsibility to establish accession standards for military service, pending the outcome of ongoing litigation.

In addition to Meese, the other signers of the letter include retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. William G. Boykin, Center for Security Policy President Frank Gaffney, Retired U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas McInerney, Retired U.S. Navy Admiral James Lyons, and Elaine Donnelly from the Center for Military Readiness.

Taking this new action would supersede the old executive action. The draft text, also obtained by Breitbart News, would allow transgender individuals to serve in the military only during the timeframe in which this court case will make its way through the court system—from the district court level all the way up through the appeals court to the Supreme Court if necessary. Their enlistment contracts would include specific provisions that they may not avail themselves of sex-change surgeries or other expensive medical options at taxpayer expense during this time, and that they will immediately be discharged from the military if and when the administration prevails in court. Doing it this way, as well, allows time for the Department of Justice to build its case out with evidence at the district court level—evidence that will eventually be considered in the very likely event that the U.S. Supreme Court eventually considers this case.

This order will likely be challenged as well. But by resetting the clock this way, a Supreme Court decision on the president’s policy would likely not come down before 2019, when it is very possible that the court will have one or two more conservative Justices in place of the potentially retiring Anthony Kennedy and the aging Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

In other words, Trump could sign a new order immediately with language close to what Meese and company are suggesting very soon. Then, the same judges at both the district court and appeals courts levels that blocked Trump’s directive from implementation would predictably block this one. The new order would replace the old one—and this new one would become the focus of the court case.

Solicitor General Noel Francisco, the Justice Department official responsible for preparing the DOJ’s legal strategy here, would then ask the Supreme Court for a stay on the lower court order blocking implementation—and by the time those actions have passed, no transgender individuals or at least very few would have gotten into the military and the case would not be on the Supreme Court docket until 2019 rather than this year, in 2018.

Again, it all remains to be seen what President Trump, the DOJ, and the Department of Defense do here in the end. The DOJ and White House have not responded to specific requests for comment about this letter and plan. But the fact that Meese, a former U.S. Attorney General for President Reagan, is signed onto this letter lends significant credibility to the idea that President Trump—who sources say has read their letter and is considering their ideas—may move forward with such a strategy.The Jerusalem Post reports: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump will meet on Thursday on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It will be the fourth meeting between the two men since Trump took office last year.

They last spoke face-to-face in September on the sidelines of the opening session of the UN General Assembly. The two men also spoke at length when Trump visited Israel in May and during Netanyahu’s trip to Washington D.C. in February.

In Washington Trump said the focus of his Davos trip was economics. “We’ll be talking about investing in the United States again, for people to come in and spend their money in the good old USA,” Trump said. But he, along with Netanyahu, is also expected to speak with world leaders there about his opposition to the Iran deal in its current form.

David J. Kramer, a former State Department official and close McCain associate, received a copy of the largely-discredited dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in the document, the Washington Post previously reported. McCain then reportedly passed the dossier directly to FBI Director James Comey.

In the magazine profile, released this week and titled, “Christopher Steele, the Man Behind the Trump Dossier,” the New Yorker reported on Kramer’s alleged plan for McCain to use the dossier to compel Trump to step down following his 2016 presidential victory. An attorney for Kramer denied there was such a plan.

New Yorker staff writer Jane Mayer reports:

The week before Thanksgiving, Wood briefed McCain at the Halifax International Security Forum. McCain was deeply concerned. He asked a former aide, David Kramer, to go to England to meet Steele. Kramer, a Russia expert who had served at the State Department, went over the dossier with Steele for hours. After Kramer promised to share the document only with McCain, Steele arranged for Kramer to receive a copy in Washington. But a former national-security official who spoke with Kramer at the time told me that one of Kramer’s ideas was to have McCain confront Trump with the evidence, in the hope that Trump would resign. “He would tell Trump, ‘The Russians have got you,’” the former official told me. (A lawyer for Kramer maintains that Kramer never considered getting Trump to resign and never promised to show the dossier only to McCain.) Ultimately, though, McCain and Kramer agreed that McCain should take the dossier to the head of the F.B.I.

Kramer reportedly recently invoked the Fifth Amendment to get out of testifying before the House Intelligence Committee regarding the dossier.

The New Yorker profile related that “Steele arranged for Kramer to receive a copy in Washington,” referring to the dossier. The magazine did not report exactly who passed the dossier copy to Kramer.

Last month, the Washington Post reported that Kramer received the dossier document directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in the dossier.

Those details marked the clearest indication yet that McCain may have known that the dossier originated with Fusion GPS, meaning that he may have knowingly passed on political material to the FBI.

It has not been been clear whether McCain was aware of the origins of the dossier when he hand delivered the unsubstantiated document to Comey.

It is still not clear whether McCain knew that Fusion GPS’s anti-Trump work resulting in the dossier was funded by Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) via the Perkins Coie law firm.

McCain has not responded to multiple Breitbart News requests seeking comment on the matter.

The details about McCain’s involvement were buried toward the end of a nearly 4,100-word February 6 Post article titled, “Hero or hired gun? How a British former spy became a flash point in the Russia investigation.”

The article was an extensive report describing the work done by Steele, who was contracted by Fusion GPS to produce the dossier. The Post article followed the release of a four-page House Intelligence Committee memo alleging abuse of surveillance authority allegedly utilizing the questionable dossier.

According to the Post, Steele originally sought out Sir Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow and friend of Steele, for advice prior to the election concerning his alleged research into Trump.

In mid-November, following Trump’s victory, Wood reportedly turned to Steele to discuss whether additional steps were necessary to ensure the U.S. government was aware of Steele’s charges about Trump and Russia.

Wood said that he then reached out to Kramer, who was known for his close ties to McCain, according to the Post.

The Post cited Wood explaining that Kramer had arranged for Wood to meet McCain in December 2016 on the sidelines of a security conference in Canada. There, Wood described detailing Steele’s claims at the meeting with McCain, telling the Arizona senator that he could arrange for the politician to review the purported research.

“I told him, ‘I know there’s a document. I haven’t read it, but it seems to me that it’s reliably set up,’” Wood told the Post.

Wood described McCain as being “visibly shocked,” and expressing interest in reading the full report.

Ten days after the Canada meeting, Kramer met Steele at Heathrow Airport in London and then went to Steele’s home, where the McCain associate spent several hours reviewing the dossier claims, according to people familiar with the events who spoke to the Post.

The Post relates that Kramer then received a physical copy of the dossier directly from Fusion GPS Co-Founder Glenn R. Simpson:

Back in Washington, Kramer received a copy of the dossier from Simpson and completed the handoff to McCain. In a private meeting on Dec. 9, McCain gave Comey the dossier — passing along information that Steele had provided to the FBI earlier in the year. Shortly before Inauguration Day, Comey briefed Trump on the document, alerting him to what the FBI director would later describe to Congress as a report that contained “salacious, unverified” information that was circulating in the media.

The Post’s reporting marks the first public description of McCain’s associate, Kramer, as having received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS.

In a New York Times oped in January, Simpson and fellow GPS Co-Founder Peter Fritch wrote that they helped McCain share their anti-Trump dossier with the Obama-era intelligence community via an unnamed “emissary.”

“After the election, Mr. Steele decided to share his intelligence with Senator John McCain via an emissary,” the Fusion GPS founders related. “We helped him do that. The goal was to alert the United States national security community to an attack on our country by a hostile foreign power.”

Simpson did not write that he directly handed the dossier to any “emissary.” It was not clear from the obscure phraseology in the Times oped whether McCain knew Fusion GPS was behind the dossier or whether the unnamed “emissary” was even aware of Fusion GPS’s connection to the document. The Post’s revelation about Kramer reportedly receiving the dossier from Simpson sheds new light on the topic.

A January 11, 2017 statement from McCain attempted to explain why he provided the Steele dossier to the FBI but did not mention how he came to possess the dossier or whether he knew who funded it.

“Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the director of the FBI,” McCain said at the time. “That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.”

Newsweek earlier reported that McCain directly Kramer to meet Steele:

Kramer was reportedly directed to meet with Steele in London by McCain, who then received copies of the Trump-Russia dossier and delivered them to the Arizona senator upon returning home. McCain then gave the dossier to the FBI in December 2016.

Also, Fox News, which saw the British court documents related to a civil lawsuit, reported that Steele testified that an arrangement was made whereby Fusion GPS would use Kramer to deliver hard copies of the dossier to McCain, who in turn gave the dossier to the FBI.

It is still unclear why McCain needed to deliver the dossier to Comey last December. By then, according to the House memo, the FBI had not only already launched an investigation into Trump’s campaign partially utilizing the dossier but Comey himself had two months earlier signed an application using the dossier to obtain a FISA warrant on Carter Page, who briefly served as a volunteer foreign policy adviser to Trump’s campaign.

Shortly after McCain gave Steele’s dossier to Comey, the FBI chief updated then President-Elect Trump and President Obama on the dossier in a classified briefing.

As Breitbart News documented, Comey’s dossier briefing to Trump was subsequently leaked to the news media, setting in motion a flurry of news media attention on the dossier, including the release of the document to the public. The briefing also may have provided the veneer of respectability to a document that had been circulating for months within the news media but widely considered too unverified to publicize.

Joshua Klein contributed research to this article.In an announcement at the White House Thursday night, South Korean National Security Director Chung Eui-yong confirmed that the North Korean dictator has extended an invitation to President Donald Trump to meet “as soon as possible,” and that Trump has accepted.

Chung met with Kim Jong-un at an unprecedented meeting of officials from the two Korean states on Monday. Upon returning to South Korea, he confirmed to news outlets there that Kim had agreed to meet South Korean President Moon Jae-in at a meeting on the south side of the border.

In his short statement in Washington on Monday, Chung reiterated his claim that Kim “said he is committed to denuclearization. He said that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear tests.”

Kim also “expressed his willingness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,” Chung added.

“President Trump … said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve total denuclearization,” he continued. He did not provide any specifics on time or potential location for such a meeting.

Chung described both himself and Trump as “optimistic about continuing a diplomatic process to test the possibility of a peaceful resolution.”

“The Republic of Korea, along with the United States, Japan, and our many partners around the world, remain fully and resolutely committed to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” he added, while asserting that “the pressure will continue until North Korea matches its words with concrete actions.”

The Trump administration has spearheaded a global effort to place unprecedented sanctions on the North Korean regime, which has consistently threatened to use nuclear weapons against American targets like New York and San Francisco. Trump has emphasized China’s role in enforcing these sanctions in particular, as the communist regime’s largest trading partner, and praised China’s communist regime for cooperating in part on pressuring Pyongyang.

The tactic appears to have worked. According to a report in South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo, the sanctions are hurting Kim’s regime in an “unprecedented” way, particularly stalling North Korea’s ability to export goods for cash.

Kim’s meeting with Moon would make him the first North Korean dictator to visit South Korea in history. His meeting with Trump, if it occurs, will also be unprecedented.

Kim is the grandson of founding North Korean tyrant Kim Il-sung and father of preceding dictator Kim Jong-il. In talks with Chung and the South Korean delegation, Kim reportedly claimed denuclearization was his father’s “dying wish,” despite Kim Jong-il’s near-total commitment of the North Korean economy to developing nuclear weapons, rather than much-needed humanitarian aid for the millions of citizens starving in his country.

North Korea forces thousands of citizens into gulags for “political re-education,” both for any behavior constructed as critical of the regime or for being related to anyone considered a threat. Under the tyrannical “songbun” caste system, families of lower “songbun” are banned from Pyongyang, kept out of the nation’s few well-earning jobs, and otherwise ostracized. Low “songbun” can be earned if parents, grandparents, or distant relatives were once opposed to Kim Il-sung’s rise during the Korean War.

North Koreans are subject to public execution if caught with Bibles or foreign media such as Hollywood films. Disabled people, useless to the regime, are hidden from public view in labor camps.

One North Korean defector said of her time in the country, “it’s the same thing as the Holocaust.”

Chung did not mention if or how the meeting of the two leaders would benefit the citizens of North Korea.Special Counsel Robert Mueller intends to financially “ruin” President Donald Trump by investigating the Trump Organization’s business operations, said Rush Limbaugh on his eponymous Thursday radio show. He also rejected ubiquitous news media and political narratives framing Special Counsel Robert Mueller as a man of integrity.

Limbaugh described Washington-based political and bureaucratic interests as broadly desiring an ousting of Trump from the presidency:

They want Trump gone. They want everybody anything to do with Trump gone. They all do. Everybody at the State Department, everybody in this immediate FBI circle with Rosenstein, Murphy, and McKinnon, the Republican establishment community, Republican consultants, they want Trump gone. Mueller is the guy to do it. Mueller is carrying the water for the entire establishment in getting Trump gone. And they don’t care how they do it. And I think their objective is to ruin him.

Limbaugh accused Mueller of seeking to “nullify” Trump’s 1995 IRS claim of approximately $900 million in operational losses in order to pursue a reclamation of the money with added penalties and accrued interest:

And these requests, the subpoena for documents from the Trump Organization, I ask you again, what has that to do with the campaign and with collusion and with the Russians? They’ve already been looking into Trump business in Russia with the Miss, what is it, USA, whatever his pageant is. Do you all remember during the early days of the campaign there was news that Trump, in a tax return something like 20 years ago, took a $900 million deduction that was granted and survived an audit by the IRS? Now, I forget the details. It had to do with losses that he had incurred in that year in building things. It was around 900 or $920 million deduction. I’ll never forget when it was reported because most people will never come close to ever having that in a lifetime, and to have a guy personally write that much off? … Anyway, I think Mueller wants that $920 million back. I think Mueller wants to prove that that was a faulty deduction. I think that they want to go back, they want to get Trump’s tax returns because they want to nullify that $900 million deduction, and then they want to collect 20 years of interest and penalties and wipe Trump out.

Limbaugh also challenged the pervasive framing of Mueller as an honorable man across the joint news media and political landscape:

We’ve been told as long as I have been aware of the name Robert Mueller, we are told that Mr. Mueller is a man of impeccable character, a man of refined tastes, a man of immense sophistication and qualification. The man was a judge, he ran the FBI, he is a fair person. He’s an all-round good guy. And in terms of people in Washington when it comes to the integrity, there are none with any more integrity than Robert Mueller. Well, I’m sorry, but that doesn’t fit with what we see this man doing. And what I ask myself is, does Mueller ever get up and ask himself, “What the hell am I doing? I don’t have a crime here. I don’t have any evidence of a crime.” Does Mueller ever get up or does anybody on his team, do they get up in the morning and they ever ask themselves, are we really doing the right thing here in seeking to destroy an American citizen whose only audacious behavior is winning the presidency?

A man of honor and integrity, suggested Limbaugh, would not accept a limitless role to pursue the political destruction of President Donald Trump: “There aren’t any limits on this guy! There is no crime that he has been charged with investigating. He’s been given a free rein to go find a crime anywhere he wants!”

“We’re told this guy’s the best of the best,” said Limbaugh. “We’re told this guy, nobody could hold a candle to him in terms of honesty and integrity and character. Well, then how does somebody with all of those fine traits even participate in a sham like this?”

Mueller’s mandate to “investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election and related matters” — issued by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein — lists no financial or temporal limitations. In addition to a nebulous scope, no specific crimes are listed within the mandate.

MoveOn.org established a “rapid response” project in the event of Trump’s firing of Mueller, soliciting contact information from persons interested in political agitation operations.

Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Ben Sasse (R-NB) — Never Trump politicians who both present themselves as conservatives — have both cast Mueller as an honorable man.

Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrentTo deflect away from her own culpability in the matter of Harvey Weinstein (a man she declared “God“), disgraced actress Meryl Streep attacked First Lady Melania Trump and President Trump’s daughter Ivanka over their “silence” regarding Weinstein. A baffling and desperate act that Donald Trump Jr. ridiculed using his Twitter account.

“Amazing that the only person in all of Hollywood who didn’t know Weinstein was a serial assaulter (of course she did) has an opinion on this,” Trump wrote.

Amazing that the only person in all of Hollywood who didn’t know Weinstein was a serial assaulter (of course she did) has an opinion on this. https://t.co/2h62gYWeby — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 4, 2018

What Streep was not asked to explain by the sycophantic New York Times in a follow-up question, is why she believes the First Lady or Ivanka would speak out against Weinstein, when, by all accounts, they did not do any business with him. Moreover, their respective brushes with the entertainment business did not include the film industry. Ivanka appeared on her father’s reality TV show. Melania was in fashion and modeling.

Streep, on the other hand, made around a half-dozen films with Weinstein over three decades. One of those titles resulted in her winning an Oscar. Others resulted in nominations.

Moreover, Streep is the Queen of Hollywood, more beloved and plugged in than anyone. The idea that the aging actress was unaware of Weinstein’s behavior, when others have credibly claimed that “everyone knew,” is preposterous.

The troubling and undeniable reality is that Streep has, in the past, shown a disturbing tolerance and affection for men who sexually abuse women. Roman Polanski, a fugitive from justice, has admitted to drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. Nevertheless, Streep not only gave Polanski a standing ovation in 2003, she has said since that he should not be imprisoned for his unforgivable crime.

Of Weinstein’s alleged crimes, which include serial rape, incredibly, Streep wrote those off as acts of “disrespect.”

Moreover, as we saw last year during the Golden Globes telecast, Streep has no regard or respect for the truth. She is very comfortable standing before the entire world while telling a provable lie.

As of right now, the-69 year-old Streep’s disapproval rating among the public sits at a dismal 58 percent, which is worse than Trump’s — whose numbers are on the rise.

But Simpson’s recently released testimony shows that at the same time he was encouraging the FBI to investigate Trump, he was actively trying to steer the FBI away from further investigation of the Clintons.

In his August 2017 testimony before Congress, Glenn Simpson admits Christopher Steele reached out to the FBI following the reopening of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in October 2016. Steele and Simpson had previously contacted the FBI regarding material they had collected on the Trump campaign — a project with no other direct tie to the Clinton investigation. Simpson claims the reopening of the Clinton probe sparked concerns on his part that the FBI was “being manipulated for political ends” by pro-Trump entities (Simpson testimony, p 179).

Yet it was Steele (with Simpson’s knowledge) who handed Clinton-funded opposition research to the FBI and then, as Simpson admits, reached out again to investigators to cast doubt on the Clinton investigation:

There was some sort of interaction, I think it was probably telephonic that occurred after Director Comey sent his letter to Congress reopening the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s e-mails. That episode, you know, obviously created some concern that the FBI was intervening in a political campaign in contravention of long-standing Justice Department regulation. So it made a lot of people, including us, concerned about what the heck was going on at the FBI. So, you know, we began getting questions from the press about, you know, whether they were also investigating Trump and, you know, we encouraged them to ask the FBI that question. You know, I think — I’m not sure we’ve covered this fully, but, you know, we just encouraged them to ask the FBI that question. (Simpson testimony, Page 178)

Even more strangely, Simpson describes Steele cutting off contact with the FBI because he didn’t understand what was going on internally:

Sometime thereafter the FBI — I understand Chris severed his relationship with the FBI out of concern that he didn’t know what was happening inside the FBI and there was a concern that the FBI was being manipulated for political ends by the Trump people and that we didn’t really understand what was going on. So he stopped dealing with them. (Simpson testimony, Page 179)

It seems very odd that Fusion GPS, or at least Steele, would expect to have any understanding of internal affairs at the FBI, especially regarding a different case from they were supplying information on. Earlier in his testimony, Simpson describes Steele’s initial meeting with the FBI:

Essentially what he told me was they had other intelligence about this matter from an internal Trump campaign source and that — that they — my understanding was that they believed Chris at this point — that they believed Chris’s information might be credible because they had other intelligence that indicated the same thing and one of those pieces of intelligence was a human source from inside the Trump organization. (Simpson testimony, Page 175)

This means the FBI divulged information about an ongoing investigation to Steele. This might not be unusual on its own (especially if agents had an existing working relationship with their source), but starts to stand out when taking Fusion GPS’ other connections into account.

During the 2016 campaign, Fusion GPS employed the wife of senior DOJ official Bruce Ohr as a subcontractor on the Trump project. Bruce Ohr met with Christopher Steele at some point during the 2016 campaign, then met with Simpson in November 2016, following the election. Also at this time, Peter Strzok, an FBI agent involved in the Clinton and Trump investigations, had sent a number of pro-Clinton text messages to a fellow FBI employee, including one discussing an “insurance policy” against Trump.

Natalia Veselnitskaya, also client of Fusion GPS at the time, met with the Trump campaign during the election, sparking further interest in the campaign’s ties to Russia. Simpson claims that he had no knowledge of this meeting (despite meeting with her before and after) and that his work for her was unrelated to his work on the Trump dossier (Simpson Testimony, p 133).President Donald Trump continued to signal support for the anti-establishment protesters in Iran on Wednesday.

“Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time!”

This is the third time that Trump signaled support for the protesters, pointedly demonstrating a different response than the Obama administration in 2009. The president also increased his level of support. On Tuesday, Trump noted that the United States was paying attention to the protests.

“The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their ‘pockets,’” he wrote. “The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!”

Trump also echoed the Iranian protesters call for change on New Year’s Day, without specific demands.

“Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration,” he wrote. “The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!”

Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government. You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2018

When asked what she wants the Trump administration to accomplish in 2018, Malkin said, “The wall, the wall, the wall.”

She continued, “In Congress, guys, now we’ve got this clamor from both parties for a so-called DACA fix. I am one of those unrepentant children of legal immigrants to this country who absolutely support everything this president is doing to put immigration enforcement and border security first, period.

She added, “You know, we have this clamor now for multi-billion dollar infrastructure deal. Right now, President Trump, until the end of his first term has one infrastructure priority – the wall, the wall, the wall.”

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENUsing his Twitter account Wednesday, the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., personally responded to reports of comments made by Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon about the Trump family. The younger Trump’s comments echoed those made by the president himself in a White House statement filled with accusations against his former chief strategist.

Among other things, the president claimed Bannon had been “fired,” was guilty of spreading “false information to the media to make himself seem far more important than he was,” and that Bannon had “little to do with our historic victory[.]”

Trump, however, did give Bannon full credit for “the loss of a Senate seat in Alabama held for more than thirty years by Republicans.”

Donald Trump Jr. also mocked Bannon over the Alabama Senate loss. “Thanks Steve. Keep up the great work,” he wrote in response to a tweet about a Democrat capturing that seat.

Thanks Steve. Keep up the great work. https://t.co/J9O8CUfJAD — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 3, 2018

A second tweet pressed this same point:

It would be amazing if there would have been a nice simple path to keeping this seat with a nice 30 point margin… #thankssteve https://t.co/uB7DXMZjiH — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 3, 2018

After Breitbart News published a series of stories covering the reports of Bannon’s comments, Don Jr. said that the reader comments on those stories showed that “Bannon has lost Breitbart[.]”

Wow, Just looked at the comments section on Breitbart. Wow. When Bannon has lost Breitbart, he’s left with . . . umm, nothing. — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 3, 2018

A few hours later, he blasted Bannon as a “nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President.”

Steve had the honor of working in the White House & serving the country. Unfortunately, he squandered that privilege & turned that opportunity into a nightmare of backstabbing, harassing, leaking, lying & undermining the President. Steve is not a strategist, he is an opportunist — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) January 3, 2018

Retweets also signaled Trump’s thoughts on Bannon. This included an accusation from the Daily Mail’s David Martosko that Bannon “was the single biggest leaker in the West Wing (until his departure).”

Partial transcript below:

OBEIDALLAH: Online, [Nikolas Cruz] had spewed anti-Semitic comments. He used the n-word, very anti-immigrant. He talked about Mexicans, wanting to kill them, hating black people because of their skin color. HARTMANN: Sounds like a normal Trump voter. OBEIDALLAH: Well, and he had worn a Trump hat a few times, which is only relevant, because you could wear it ironically, but it’s relevant because everything he spewed was consistent with the Trump agenda, to be quite blunt; anti-Muslim, anti-black, anti-immigrant, he’s anti-gay, as well, and of course Donald Trump wanted to impose a ban on transgender Americans serving in our military. Everything there was every box of a white supremacist, and with the swastikas adding to that, there’s something going on, and our media’s really uncomfortable exploring this. That’s what I really get a sense of.

Politically-motivated murders are mostly rooted in “right-wing” politics, said Hartmann.

“Over the last twenty years, we’ve had more people killed by right-wingers than any other group,” said Hartmann, receiving agreement from Obeidallah.

“Less than two percent” of terrorist attacks in Europe between 2009 and 2014 were committed by Muslims, alleged Obeidallah in a 2015-published article.

The news media landscape broadly hypes sensational crimes committed by non-whites, Muslims, and foreigners while diminishing the same types of crimes committed by whites, said Obeidallah.

“The media is run by ratings and what sells,” said Obeidallah. “The media narrative sells the scary brown guy who’s a Muslim or who’s a foreigner, or the scary black guy. The scary white guy has to be mentally unstable.”

Whites who “commit horrible acts” — contrary to their black or brown counterparts — do not have their political motivations examined by the news media, alleged Obeidallah. “The media narrative is that, if you’re white, that mental illness must be almost exclusively the reason for why you commit horrible acts, and if you’re brown or black, they look for other things. If you’re Muslim, we know exactly where they go.”

“Over half of the extremist-related deaths on U.S. soil were by white supremacists,” said Obeidallah, drawing on assertions made by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an organization ostensibly committed to combating anti-Semitism.

“Half of the active hate groups [in America] are white supremacists,” said Obeidallah, drawing on assertions made the Southern Policy Law Center (SPLC), an organization ostensibly committed to tracking “hate groups.”

Obeidallah contributes to both CNN and The Daily Beast.

Follow Robert Kraychik on Twitter @rkraychik.The Chinese state newspaper Global Times chided U.S. President Donald Trump Wednesday in a piece analyzing the removal of Rex Tillerson from his position as secretary of state, claiming the high turnover in the administration shows Trump has a “lack of willingness or ability” to “see disagreements resolved.”

The critique comes on the week that Chinese leader Xi Jinping announced the creation of a “National Supervisory Commission” more powerful than the nation’s supreme court, tasked with weeding out “corruption” and any ideological dissenters from the Communist Party.

The Global Times has repeatedly criticized the United States in general for allowing a diversity of political opinions to thrive in public, deeming this a state of “division” and “chaos.”

Xi’s regime also banned the phrase “I don’t agree” from social media platforms this month.

Despite Xi Jinping’s record of resolving disagreements with brutal state force, the Times lamented the removal of Tillerson as a sign that President Trump has no tolerance for dissent. Noting that, before Tillerson, “over a dozen high officials in the Trump Administration left their posts,” the Global Times claimed that “one can reasonable argue” that Trump possesses “a lack of willingness or ability … to see disagreements resolved.”

“As the tribulations inside the Trump Administration mount, such news foretells of a lack of decision and efficacy in Washington on the global stage,” the newspaper argued.

The Global Times then goes on to list a series of issues in which Trump’s stances have not changed since he announced his run for president—”climate change, world trade, and the status of Jerusalem”—as areas that have become a “cause of concern” due to Trump’s “unpredictability” and his administration’s “half-handed” foreign policy.

The Times also complains that Trump’s announcement that he would accept a meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un was “unexpected” to China, exposing the Chinese government’s displeasure at being relegated to a minor role in the North Korean crisis. In other articles, the Global Times has launched a campaign to give all credit for that meeting to Xi Jinping and dismiss observers who claim Trump “marginalized” the communist country.

The state newspaper also has little positive to say about CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who will succeed Tillerson at the State Department. Pompeo, the Times notes, is “known for his stern views” and his positioning as top diplomat will lead “to uncertainty and a higher risk.”

Xinhua, China’s more “objective” state news outlet, also weighed in on the replacement of Tillerson with Pompeo, suggesting that Pompeo’s rise “may indicate further aggressiveness in U.S. foreign policy and the U.S. trade stance.” The outlet cited “U.S. media” as claiming that Tillerson was removed for unpleasant “body language during meetings” and never quite being “Trump’s guy.”

China’s relationship with Tillerson, a longtime businessman who approached the diplomatic job with a conciliatory outlook, had soured in the past year. Tillerson first approached China with a statement urging “no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” almost verbatim echoing Xi’s communist propaganda, but in recent months escalated his criticism of China’s business practices, particularly the oppressive nature of its debt agreements with developing countries.

Tillerson repeatedly used the word “predatory” in 2018 to describe the loans China offered countries in Africa and Latin America to get them to participate in One Belt, One Road (OBOR), a sprawling economic initiative for China to build roads, ports, and train stations connecting Beijing to western Europe. Chinese officials have insisted that Latin America must be connected to the Ancient Silk Road, urging countries like Ecuador and Venezuela to take out loans and allow China access to their ports. The program would conclude with brand-new infrastructure in the hands of the Chinese government, enriching the Chinese at the expense of local people, who would then have to pay back their astronomical loans.

Before what would become his final overseas trip as secretary of state, Tillerson warned African states of this threat.

“Chinese investment does have the potential to address Africa’s infrastructure gap, but its approach has led to mounting debt and few, if any, jobs in most countries,” he warned. “When coupled with the political and fiscal pressure, this endangers Africa’s natural resources and its long-term economic political stability.”

China, he added, “encourages dependency using opaque contracts, predatory loan practices, and corrupt deals that mire nations in debt and undercut their sovereignty, denying them their long-term, self-sustaining growth.”

In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry attacked Tillerson for his “irresponsible” remarks and urged the United States not to comment on China’s relationships with underprivileged countries.

How this relationship to the State Department will change under Pompeo remains to be seen, but some observers expect a hard-line approach towards China’s disruptive colonization plans around the world.

“It says to China: ‘You are our enemy,’” CNBC’s Jim Cramer said of Pompeo’s nomination on Tuesday. “This is about China being our intellectual and economic enemy.”

This week, before Tillerson’s departure, Pompeo said in a Fox News interview that he was extremely concerned with China’s plans to take over much of the international waters surrounding it.

“If you look at the president’s national security strategy, it was very clear that what the Chinese are doing, whether that would be on trade or the theft of intellectual property or their continued advancement in East and South China Seas, this administration is prepared and engaged in pushing back against the Chinese threats so that we can have a good relationship with China in a way that the world desperately needs,” Pompeo said.

In January, Pompeo suggested that China presents a much greater threat to American interests than Russia. “The Chinese have a much bigger footprint upon which to execute that mission than the Russians do,” he told BBC. “We can watch very focused efforts to steal American information, to infiltrate the United States with spies—with people who are going to work on behalf of the Chinese government against America.”Sunday on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” host Brian Stelter said President Donald Trump’s tweet saying the FBI missed the warning on Florida shooter because they are working on the Russia investigation was more evidence that “questions” about his fitness for office are so urgent.”

Stelter said Trump sounded “deeply trouble” and “unhinged.”

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign – there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2018

Stelter said “This has been a talking point from pro-Trump media ever since Friday that there is a link between the FBI’s failure and the ongoing Russia probes. This is nonsensical.”

He added, “Here are just some of the tweets from the president. You look at what he is doing here. He is undercutting his own national security adviser, he is ranting and raving about the fake media, he has got tweets riddled with misspellings and profanity. Maybe in person, President Trump is cool, calm, and collected. But on Twitter, he sounds deeply troubled. He sounds unhinged. This is why questions about his fitness for office are so urgent. This is the biggest story that I see happening right now.”

Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNENWednesday on CNN’s “Situation Roomr,” Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said President Donald Trump’s criticisms of Attorney General Jeff Sessions could be “part of a continuing pattern to obstruct justice” in Special Counsel Robert Muller’s Russia probe.

Partial transcript as follows:

BLITZER: What do you make of this public humiliation of his attorney general?

JEFFRIES: Well, first of all, President Trump clearly doesn’t understand the role of the attorney general. He is the people’s attorney, not the president’s personal attorney. So this is all part of the dysfunction we’ve seen in the Trump White House. Sessions is fighting with Trump. Trump is fighting with Bannon. Bannon is fighting with Kushner. Kushner is fighting with Kelly. He’s fighting with Scaramucci. Do you know who is losing? The American people.

BLITZER: He’s fighting back. He says it is the appropriate process and the inspector general, he could come up with conclusions and recommend prosecution if he feels that’s appropriate. That’s the normal way things are done.

JEFFRIES: At the end of the day, here’s what is really disgraceful. Donald Trump continues to refuse to release his taxes to the American people. This is disgraceful. He fired the director of the FBI in the middle of an investigation into his campaign. That is disgraceful. He refuses to do anything about the continuing Russian attacks on our democracy in advance of the mid-term elections. That’s disgraceful. When Donald Trump tweets things like did he this morning, it is all designed to be a distraction.

BLITZER: But can he really do his job? The president was angry at him when he recused himself as far as the Russia probe is concerned.

JEFFRIES: It would be difficult. But I think Senator Grassley, the chairperson, has previously gone on record to say that if Sessions is forced out, a lot of things we have to do and he has no intention of holding a hearing to confirm a new attorney general. So Donald Trump may be trapped.

BLITZER: I want to put up on the screen some of the criticisms You can see some of the words he has used, Idiot, beleaguered, very weak, very disappointed with him, he did a terrible thing, and now disgraceful, all caps with an exclamation point. Yet Sessions continues on the job. Some are suggesting that the president has done that. He wants him out so he can name someone else who would be more supportive.

JEFFRIES: This may be part of a continuing pattern to obstruct justice and to shape the Mueller investigation in a manner that could go to Trump’s benefit. That could be problematic. What I also find problematic is that Donald Trump is attacking his own attorney general, one of his best friends, closest allies, on the campaign trail, his earliest endorser from the United States Senate. He’s attacked our allies in this country. He attacked Great Britain, attacked Canada, attacked France, attacked Germany, attacked Mexico attacked Australia, but he can’t say a single negative word about Vladimir Putin and that fundamentally is the problem. And this back and forth with Jeff Sessions illustrates the dramatic double standard that he has.CNN’s Oliver Darcy reports:

President Trump might be facing a period of stormy news coverage over allegations he paid to cover up an affair with a porn star, but it’s mostly clear skies in the conservative media universe.

Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels, made national headlines earlier this week when she filed a lawsuit against Trump alleging he never signed a non-disclosure agreement that prevented her from speaking out about their alleged sexual relationship. Trump has denied the alleged affair, but on Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders conceded the existence of a non-disclosure agreement when she said arbitration had been won “in the President’s favor.”

The revelations ricocheted through the mainstream press. It was on the front page of Thursday’s edition of The New York Times and given prominent placement in the Washington Post. Both CNN and MSNBC spent ample time discussing it on air.

During a statement at the White House on Thursday, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong stated that Kim Jong-un “expressed his eagerness” to meet with President Trump and Trump stated he would meet with North Korea’s leader by May.

Chung said, “Kim pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests. He understands that the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue. And he expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible. President Trump appreciated the briefing, and said he would meet Kim Jong-un by May to achieve permanent denuclearization.”

He added that South Korea, the US, and their partners will keep pressure on North Korea until it matches its words with actions.

News of a much smaller, yet not altogether insignificant triumph for Trump diplomacy emerged in the NFL.

What great victory was this? The victory appears to be Trump’s ability to convert an NFL owner — who once proudly supported the anthem protests — with a single tweet.

Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross delivered a strong message on Monday, informing all that when the anthem plays, his players will be on their feet.

While in New York to accept the ROBIE Lifetime Achievement Award from the Jackie Robinson Foundation, Ross told the Daily News, “All of our players will be standing.”

Ross, who initially supported the players protest efforts, described his journey from accepting the protests to wanting them to end.

“Initially, I totally supported the players in what they were doing. It’s America and people should be able to really speak about their choices.”

However, Ross eventually changed his mind. What caused him to change his mind? In no small part, Ross attributes the change to a tweet from President Trump.

In September, Trump tweeted: “If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU’RE FIRED. Find something else to do!”

Trump’s changing of the narrative seemed to change Ross’ mind about the public’s perception of the protests.

“When that message changed, and everybody was interpreting it as that was the reason, then I was against kneeling,” Ross told the Daily News. “I like Donald (Trump). I don’t support everything that he says. Overall, I think he was trying to make a point, and his message became what kneeling was all about. From that standpoint, that is the way the public is interpreting it. So I think that’s really incumbent upon us to adopt that. That’s how, I think, the country now is interpreting the kneeling issue.”

According to the Daily News, “Ross said he’s still in communication with Trump – the two men’s football ties stretch all the way back to the USFL days before that football league folded – and Ross said he thinks the president ‘is concentrated on making the country better.'”

UPDATE: In a statement to the Sun-Sentinel, Dolphins Owner Stephen Ross has sought to clarify his remarks to the Daily News.

Ross said, “I have no intention of forcing our players to stand during the anthem.”

Ross continued, “I’ve seen the same players who are fighting for social justice engaging positively with law enforcement and the military. I care passionately that the message of social justice resonates far and wide, and I will continue to support and fund efforts for those who fight for equality for all.”
